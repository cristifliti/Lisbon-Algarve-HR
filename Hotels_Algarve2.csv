The room and facilities were very clean and stylish. I also enjoyed having breakfast each morning. Additionally the location was perfect! 50 mins from the airport 5 minutes from the beach 10 minutes to the strip where all the bars and restaurants were.

Nice clean comfortable very friendly and helpful personnel very good breakfast. The nearest beach is just a couple of minutes away (their beach towels are great btw ask the reception if you need one they don't seem to offer them in the room by default). They also have an underground garage for a reasonable extra price if you have a car (there are free parking places in the area as well but rather limited and we found it very convenient with the garage). cons: I don't think it has a gym (at least we didn't see any). The balcony in our room was small and facing the road and the noise didn't make it so pleasant to sit there but you do get a little bit of ocean view. It doesn't spoil the overall good impression.

Inside was overall clean and new. cons: During 3 day stay shampoo shower gel got empty and we had to ask sepparately for refill. One time we were provided dirty towel and bathrobe. However - these problems were solved very quickly. So once again the staff was very good. The beds were not too comfortable and the street side was a little bit too noisy. Breakfast was good but had no variety.

Rochavau Hotel,en-us,2023-08-07,2023-08-12,couple,leisure,es,1.20000004768372,5,2023-08-13 20:13:24,"pros: The room was nice with enough space.
The swimming pool was very good and there was good facilities such as showers and WCs available. cons: The hotel is clearly understaffed with people from reception having to clean tables during breakfast when too many guests are coming down at the same time. Also there's not enough room for many guests because the breakfast area is too small for the hotel capacity and a line is formed with delays of up to 20 mins to get some breakfast (line is also formed even for getting coffee once you get your table).
Room cleaning is very poor as they claim they clean them from 15.00 to 18.00 which is crazy because if you went to the beach or on a tour and want to take a shower and have a nap you might get caught by the cleaning staff.
They also have skipped or poorly made our room more than once during our stay leaving dirty cups and trash not taken away unmade beds not changed towels etc. We had to complain more than once and they even got the face to tell us that we left the ""do not disturb"" sign when we clearly left the other ""please make the room"" (both signs have the same color on both sides of the card which calls for this kind of trouble if staff misread them).
Lastly we selected a Queen size bed and they gave us a Twin beds instead (they do not make that clear here in Booking like other hotels do) and when we told them they said that they don't have queen size so the publishing of the rooms is either wrong or misleading. On the same line the advertised ""room service"" does not exist as they only offer coffee or small beverages and not really food to serve on the room or anything like that.
On a final note during checkout we gave this feedback again and they only offered a 5% discount for our next stay... Considering the poor service provided for a 4 star hotel and that we aren't ever going back I'd say is a cheap tactic with low risk for them to save face."

Pero pienso que no pueden cambiar por su cuenta una reserva porque luego les llegue un grupo que quieran poner todo junto y no tengan más espacio.
Encima ese grupo llegaba al día siguiente.
La gestión de reservas un desastre."

I especially appreciated the attentiveness and professionalism of the staff who were always ready to assist with any request. a wonderful variety of fresh fruits that added a delightful touch to the morning meal cons: bathrobes provided in the rooms the pool should open earlier than 9 AM and swimming caps should be supplied by the hotel.

Pool on roof was lovely
Air con/ heating very efficient and welcome in December
Wi-Fi very good and with no password very straightforward for a non tech person cons: Balcony on my room 408 was tiny and overshadowed by a huge tree...ok for a short December break but not in nicer weather.
Staff were helpful when approached but didn't make any effort to help otherwise....no indication of where pool/spa/bar were located. Also a personal preference....I like corporate image and would have liked staff at least in identifiable polo shirts. Breakfast staff could have been more helpful with machines.
No real bar/coffee shop just a couple of soft chairs."

The main and daily dishes were classic English breakfast ingredients. Any sausages beans grilled tomatoes and fried mushrooms are indigestible dishes for someone from the continent. If someone wanted something different they had at their disposal: three types of yellow cheese two types of ham eggs sliced ​​tomatoes and cucumbers. Every day exactly the same poor quality products were served. There was a lack of salads and olives and other local products. The cakes also left much to be desired. The most delicious cookies in Portugal - pasteis de nata - could not be eaten in this hotel. We consider it scandalous in a 4* hotel to serve instant coffee during breakfast. This was the first time we had encountered something like this in Portugal. You had to pay extra for an espresso. We also did not like the arrangement of tables in the hotel restaurant. They are so close to each other that either the person from the next table or people passing by constantly nudge you. When we wanted to sit in quieter places at tables by the window the waiters were very careful not to take a table for four. So we sat at a table for two by a busy passageway while a table for four stood empty.

Have been several times before and never fails to deliver. Stayed in the Deluxe Suite this time and loved all the little extras from management. Beach is wonderful and not too busy this time of year(late September). Shame we can't always control the weather late on in the season but a gem of a stay nonetheless. 10/10😊 cons: Am really nit picking now and this is completely personal - but the music at breakfast and dinner was a bit intrusive and was the same playlist everyday all day during our stay - love background music but perhaps mix it up and not all Bon Jovi!! 😄 Thanks

It was my friend's 50th birthday and the hotel arranged a cake and wine which was so lovely. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. cons: The only very minor negative (which actually was also a positive) is the pool. It is on the roof beautiful there is a bar and it is spotless. But it is quite small so some people were unable to use a sun lounger. That said the fact it was small meant that it wasn't overcrowded and was just a wonderful peaceful experience. Oh - book transfers before you get there The taxi from the hotel to airport was eu 100!!! Booking through booking.com was 60.

We didn’t mind choosing from the more expensive menu but it was almost taken that we wouldn’t want to do that.

It's a very clean environment relaxing view and I absolutely enjoyed every bit of it.  I needed a peaceful and relaxed holiday for my birthday. The hotel surprised me with a birthday cake and prosecco bottle which I taught was a great touch. 
Breakfast was delicious very healthy filling and fresh. We had fresh fruits and juices every day and varieties of pastries hot and cold. They kept on replenishing as it goes until the last minute for breakfast. The staff were very friendly smiley always willing to help and very informative. 
The location is perfect right in the centre of a tourist location surrender by other hotels. 10-15 min walk to the beach a very calm and peaceful and relaxing environment. cons: Everything about this hotel was outstanding.

Nice bathroom with a bidet
Good tea & coffee facility in the room with a little fridge
Good hotel location 
Good breakfast & dinner cons: There isn’t enough room around the buffet at breakfast & dinner and also the restaurant space is too small. You don’t need that artificial tree in the middle of the dining room as it makes difficult for people to access their table and the restaurant room is too small anyway for such a big artificial tree. You should put it outside in the terrace as a decoration.
I didn’t like the fact that I had to book for my breakfast the night before.
Also the buffet in the evening quickly runs out of food and one has to wait for the food. The nice dessert run out quickly and was replaced with some yogurt 😕
Finally the coffee is bad…. Can’t you have proper filter coffee and proper teapots!"

Rooms was clean staff overall are nice and friendly besides one person in the restaurant who reassigns the tabels during the breakfast time. She literally poisoned my stay. cons: 1. The person who welcome you during breakfast and reassigns the tabels in the restaurant it was awful experience! The hotel receved low score just because of this one person! We stayed for 5 days and everyday she used to give us table in the exit where was very tight and not nice but I prefer sometimes to get table near the window and not in the dark corridor. I get it there a lot of guests everybody deserves a good table etc. And for me personally it was important and I especially asked her if we can seat on the ""other empty prepaired table for two"" and every time we got a NO answer and exuses like these ""tabels was with other people"" they reserved etc-this is literally what she told me! I did not want to argue but it made me feel very uncomfortable. While we were having breakfast I saw how new couples were arriving and she was giving them those empty ""reserved"" tables. I would never ask table for 4 people for example because I get it there families with kids etc. But free tabels already served and she send us away every day!! How breakfats tabels can be reserved in prepaid breakfasts in the lobby of the hotel??? I was very irritated in the end of our stay which you dont want on holidays right? I suspect she took money from people to reassign them better tabels otherwise it was something personal etc. My opinion hotyel should not keep such employees!
2. Paid parking!"

Location good and I loved that they lend bikes to guests. The gym was great but despite being open 24hrs twice l had arrived and it was locked. Breakfast was good I think I expected more variety though. cons: The open corridors make you cold the minute you walk outside your room. The spa needs to be booked which is fine but on our last day we booked and arrived to the spa closed and sauna turned off they told us it would have taken 1 hour to warm up and we couldn't wait. My husband and I both found the jacuzzi too cold. The TV in our room was extremely slow.

Short walking distance from the beach. cons: We stayed for 3 nights. The bedroom windows didn't isolate the noise coming from the outside and it was very noisy during the night with people talking and screaming on the street and dogs barking all night long.
We stayed in a suite which living room window  faced an internal corridor and it wasn't nice to see. The bed had one side against the wall (really strange to see this in a suite) not practical and comfortable at all for the one sleeping on that side. After complaining we were offered a room with 2 twin beds which we refused as this didn't meet what we were looking and paid for. The suite size is good but not practical with a lot of empty space that could be used to provide the guests more comfort.
The bathroom was really small comparing to the size of the room. Not perfectly clean as it had hair sand on the floor when we arrived. The bath tub where the shower is also located had a leak so after having a shower the floor was flooded with water.
Nice pool area on the roof top but the only time we tried to have a snack there we were told there was no bread. I'm sorry but this is not the standard of a 4 star hotel.
Overall I felt disappointed. The hotel is over rated and didn't meet the value for money I was expecting."

The breakfast was very good and plenty of choice cons: Went for dinner in the hotel Fuel Restaurant on the first night and noticed the buffet laid out. I asked if dinner was a buffet that evening and also asked if there was an a la Carte option. I was told it was a buffet. Halfway through our dinner we were told we were not entitled to the buffet and should have had the al la carte! Tried to explain but the waiter was not interested. 
Unfortunately we had to depart from the hotel six days early due to illness. We were not offered any kind of refund even though it was due to illness. When mentioned to the reception staff they told me there was a no refund policy and there was nothing they could do. This was very disappointing and I felt also unfair."

There was lots to choose from and it was all fresh and well prepared. The public areas of the hotel are pleasant with lots of unusual artefacts. The staff were friendly and very  helpful. cons: The bath had mold around the top and needed re-grouting. Both pools are quite small especially the indoor one which you understandably have to book to use and we did not manage to get a booking to swim which is one of our top pleasures when holidaying. No facilities for disabled ie nearby car parking handles in bathroom and no shower mat. The entrance floor was super slippery as if they use polish on it which is dangerous for elderly or disabled travellers.

- Reception / lobby area is lovely and relaxing with books and magazines to read
- Check-in is really relaxed and thorough 
- Sea view rooms are well worth the upgrade 
- Early breakfast is recommended and booking ahead means you avoid over crowding 
- Quality of food and drinks were excellent
- The freshly squeezed orange juice was amazing! cons: - The Standard rooms were huge and lovely but paper thin walls so you could hear everything
- I had asked to change rooms because I had specifically requested a quiet room but the noise of the room next door was too disturbing. I had to ask 7/8 times before moving rooms. I was moved (and paid for) a Sea view room on the 5th floor which was much better & much quieter but it was exhausting having to ask so many times to move.
- I had a spa treatment one day which was lovely but no one showed me around the facilities. 
- I didn’t get details of the daily classes which I would like to have joined.
- The gym isn’t great if you’re a weight lifter / body builder; only a few kettle bells and a Kinetic machine but good for a general workout and good cardio options.
- Lots of food empty if you arrive late for breakfast"

The breakfast was lovely although I think they could have more juices and a few more things to choose from it was very busy so maybe that could be why…
Very well located and easy to get to the restaurants etc… cons: Bedroom decoration was a bit flat.
The rooftop pool bar closed at like 6pm I don’t know whether this is normal or it was because it was windy but there were still a few people there when it closed.
They gave us cards to pick up towels at the reception for the pool but we went to pick up some towels and they didn’t have any and didn’t even apologize for it actually I found the girl at the reception a little bit uninterested and she was also the one who received us for check in and I found her a little bit apathetic.
We were very disappointed about not being able to use the Spa seeing as I chose this Hotel mainly because of it and I was told it would be functioning by the time we were due to the Hotel but they informed us 2 days before our reservation that the Spa wasn’t working and so they gave us 2 drinks vouchers for the rooftop bar which was nice but still didn’t make up for it to be honest."

O tipo de construção dos corredor ""abertos"" que em dias de chuva leva-nos a ""apanhar frio"" entre o quarto e a recepção. Algo que não é muito usual mas também não é grave."

Camas de matrimonio king size muy cómodas. Desayuno muy bueno. Amenities Rituals. Tuvieron un detalle con nosotros que agradecemos. La zona del restaurante muy acogedora y con comida de calidad. En temporada alta los precios se disparan pero en otras temporadas los precios son accesibles y merece la pena. Si puedes hacer un upgrade de habitación se nota (habitación en planta alta terraza  loción de cuerpo Rituals albornoz y chanclas agua café etc.) por poco más. cons: Lo único que noté esta última vez es el accionamiento automático de los aires acondicionados que emitían un molesto ruido en la noche pero poca cosa.

O pequeno almoço estava ótimo com imensa variedade e qualidade. Gostámos dos equipamentos de ginásio da piscina e da sauna. Simpático o welcome drink que nos ofereceram. cons: Os Quartos com muito pouca insonorização ainda nos mudaram do quarto inicialmente atribuído junto aos elevadores mas ainda assim ouvia-se imenso os sons da rua dos quartos contíguos e de uma forma absurda as portas a bater do corredor. Dado que os corredores são abertos para o exterior torna ainda o som mais propagado. Como o target do hotel são maioritariamente estrangeiros tivemos uma má experiência numa das noites com um hóspede que chegou embriagado e a gritar e que nos acordou.
 No pedido na reserva mencionámos de que o nosso objetivo era descansar bem como tínhamos como objectivo usufruir dos equipamentos para relaxar. 
Fomos acordados todos os dias a partir de cerca das 8h pela equipa da limpeza que obviamente está a desempenhar o seu trabalho mas que ao mesmo tempo com a agitação inerente ao seu trabalho não nos permitia descansar até um pouco mais tarde como gostaríamos de férias e deixámos esse feedback no check-out. Para quem pretende uma experiência mais relaxante acho importante terem o cuidado de terem pisos que permitam ter essa possibilidade de ter menos barulho."

Desayuno abundante con zumo natural y te cocinaban huevos fritos a demanda cons: Quisimos café de máquina y lo tuvimos que pagar a parte en el desayuno. En la habitación durante la noche se oía mucho el ruido del cuadro eléctrico (un zumbido constante) cuando lo desconectamos se encendió la luz de emergencia de la habitación por lo que no pudimos dormir demasiado bien.

El salón es precioso. La piscina esta en la azotea y dispone de bar por si quieres tomar algo no hay muchas hamacas pero suele estar disponible alguna. Lo mejor de la habitación además de lo bonita que es es la cama king size supercomoda tanto la cama como las almohadas. Lo peor por ponerle algo es el parking que toda la zona es de pago y la aplicación para no tener que estar cada 4 h cambiando el tiket es anti turistas ya que no te permite darte de alta si no tienes un dni portugues ni cuenta alli. Situación estupenda la playa esta a 7 minutos andado. cons: el parking que fue una odisea. Ademas el hotel dispone de muy pocas plazas. La app del parking es antituristas.

El personal en general no era demasiado amable exceptuando tres empleados que fueron encantadores.
La prohibición de dejar cosas en la nevera de la habitación asegurándote que tirarían cualquier producto que encontraran. 
El calor y la larga espera para cenar en el restaurante. Más de 30 minutos y no estaba lleno.

Good buffet breakfast. Lovely deck for lunch and dinner providing beautiful views. Lovely shade under the pine trees for those who prefer the shade but lots of places to sunbathe too. cons: The outside pool would benefit from heating. It wasn’t a problem at the time of the year we went early September but if it had been in spring autumn or even early summer I would’ve found it too cold despite the warm air temperatures. 
Too many sunbeds in the pool area. Not all were occupied but if they had been guest would almost be on top of each other."

Room was relatively spacious but our one lacked a balcony which was disappointing. Pool is very nice with adequate number of beds nearby with umbrellas. Steps down to the beach are pretty steep and likely tricky for older folks especially on the way back up (though there are some rest chairs where someone can take a rest if need be along the stairs). Beach though is really beautiful and lovely to walk along. cons: There was a smell in our bathroom after using the shower. Sort of like stale water stuck in the downpipes. Not too nice. Referred it to reception who said would get it looked at. Never received any indication that it was checked but it lingered for other days albeit at lower level (or maybe our noses were just attuned to it). One annoying thing at breakfast was some of the staff clearing your plates just after you had finished eating off them. Was intrusive and I'd have been on the cusp of telling them to just go away. This was just a few people others were very nice and mannerly. At the beach found the restaurant at beach entrance very busy staff rude and prices high. Went once but would not go back.

SPA was average clearly stuff is not professional (some of them serve in buffet as well): they follow a protocol but once it comes to massage / face treatment itself we know immediately there is no any related education at all. 
Pool is never truly clean but warm enough. 
What I found truly scandalous is that with all-inclusive option water is not included ! Even a usual tap/filtered water! You can buy for 470€ 750ml of water so it’s not like if they sell it at adequate price. We were truly surprised by drinks price (920€ for a smoothie?) it felt more like Paris than Portugal."

Pool area very nice overall areas to rest and enjoy the views of the coast are absolutely beautiful. cons: Pool wasn't heated so not usable. Bar lacks ""energy"" looks dated or being part of a retirement facility. Music choices particularly live music was geared toward non-existing-patrons. Means no local music and atmosphere. The result was that the place was mostly empty. While the breakfast choices and dinner-buffet choices are really good the setup creates the feeling of a cattle drive where too many folks try to access the buffet and at the same time people are entering or leaving the restaurant using the same small aisles..."

Large clean pool and lots of loungers but we went in April so maybe busy in the summer. The pool was cold but I still went in and enjoyed it. The hotel is close to restaurants and a small town with some shops and bars. Driving distance to Albufeira. Private beautiful beach area for the hotel however lots of stairs down. But no worries lovely beach within walking distance. The restaurant served delious food and staff was warm and friendly. 
Breakfast was top notch! They made omelettes to order fried eggs. Bacon sausages fruit pancakes...I could go on and on! And your own pot of coffee and milk for your table was a nice touch.
The view eating breakfast was glorious. We stayed in a standard room with balcony and a sea view. We could sit on the large balcony and just take it all in. I also liked the little hangers outside to put your wet bathing suits to dry.  Our room was standard but clean and a nice spacious bathroom. Fluffy towels comfortable bed. Good housekeeping. A fridge safe and I can't remember but thought there was a kettle or coffee maker. 
They had entertainment in the bar that was maybe a bit cheesy for a younger crowd. I actually really enjoyed it because it was nice to stay in the hotel in the evening and I thought the music had good variety. We stayed for 3 nights but didn't want to leave! cons: Just a note: Lots of stairs to the beach if you have mobility issues."

The evening buffet was decent - we tried it twice - there was a lot of choice even if no item was particularly good - with a kid in tow that was useful to ensure they wld find something worth eating.  Didnt get to try the outdoor pool as it was cold and didn't see many people swimming in there. The indoor pool was warm with temps between 28-32C which was great for swimming with a 2 year old. cons: The children play areas both indoor and outdoor were quite poor. The 3HB opposite had much better play facilities for kids - which made this hotel feel a bit dated. They only offered 1 bottle of water at check-in there was no replenishment of the bottle every night which shld be common practice.

Please be patient with them during the off season - probably less people working so they are very busy but trying their hardest. Some guests were quite rude to the workers. Spa services were great the location and view is amazing. Perfect for a relaxing stay! cons: There was no option for double beds (the rooms have single beds next to each other so there’s a gap). Maybe if you upgrade the room size.

The food is excellent and the staff very helpful. I had a room with a balcony and sea view with full board included an excellent value. cons: Only a few minor points-the minibar was empty on purpose but the form for ordering drinks was missing. You have to use your room key to get any electrical power in the room which is awkward and annoying when the TV pops on each time. The duo playing music in the bar was really really awful like super cheesy.

They had an indoor kids playroom also which was a nice surprise. The room was spacious clean and warm as it was a cooler month of the year. 

 The buffet breakfast had a great variety it was very busy so good to get down early but it was always fully stocked with everything. Crepes were a big hit with my toddler.

The staff were AMAZING. Mariana looked after us everyday for lunch in the restaurant by the pool. Everyone was so so lovely. cons: The hotel was closing until February we would have extended if it was open. We will be back again in the summer!"

We would strongly recommend anyone visiting Albufeira to stay at this place instead of anywhere within the Albufeira town. It is close enough to the town (15 mins by taxi) to be able to visit anytime you want and far enough to enjoy its own private beach at Falesia. There are two swimming pools one outside and one indoors with jacuzzi. We loved the indoors one during cloudy days. The view from the facility over the cliffs is breathtaking. Only a few flights of stairs lead you to the pristine Falesia Beach which is almost empty during sunrise hours. The breakfast at the resort is amazing with a lovely spread and so are the buffet dinners. If you want something else you will find a few nice restaurants within 5-10 minutes walking distance. Overall this is the best resort experience we had in Europe. Highly recommended. cons: If we nitpick we will have to say that the Italian restaurant and the night bar on the property are not the best we had. We would expect better cocktails at such a resort. The buffet dinner was honestly better in value and quality over the Italian restaurant. That's all everything else was amazing.

You can get taxis for cheap enough to either town but just something to bear in mind.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel for four nights and any time that they cleaned the room they did not leave a soap in the room any time we asked they were so reluctant to give us any and that was the only option to wash our hands no other alternative we had shampoo and body wash but no hand wash they just gave us one more in the last day which we did not use.same issue with the beach towel I had to come up reception for beach towel it took them 20 mins to provide us with beach towels it was none left in the room when I stated that to the reception they called the room service to make sure there was none left at our room I was offended they acted such a way as we are lying .I don't know why they made such a big deal with that.

We also did not like the dinner tried it once and never again .we went to the nearby hotel for dinner and it was top notch."

There was also some stunning view points of the amazing cliffs and beach below with seating to sit back and take in the views.

We also enjoyed the daily  Happy hour!

There were daily Yoga classes that  added to the feeling of relaxation the hotel promoted.

Having a 12pm checkout was also useful . cons: That there only appeared to be one toilet for each sex in the reception/bar area. So I had to keep going back to our room to use the facilities there .
There was a  lack of background music on the terrace bar and in the Italian restaurant.  It would have added to the ambience to have some easy listening jazz or lounge music playing. The Italian restaurant did have a live band twice a week which was good if you were eating there.

The access to the stunning beach below the hotel was not for those with limited mobility or physical disabilities but they were well made and not too steep with level parts to break the desent. 136 steps though!"

Beautiful landscape seaviews & one of most beautiful accessible beaches in Europe. It takes about 10min walk down to the beach. We spent whole days there. Rooms need a brush-up looking a bit dated but functional clean. Balcony useful & welcome. The food is also very good. Plenty of choice variety & good quality. We would go again. cons: Rooms a bit dated. Alarms going off around 6:30am several days not sure why?

We didn’t love it the first time but the beach location was better than any other option we saw at this price point. We also preferred this beach to others down the stretch as our “home” beach. It is clean not built up and has plenty of room. The tides are not too bad for swimming and the views are amazing. 

This time around we did more exploring. If you go at low tide you can walk along the beach across several town areas. It was a great way to get out of the resort and resort food options - we had lunch at another beach and walked back at high tide along the roads stopping in a neighboring town area for dinner. Would recommend!

The resort itself is clean and the staff were lovely. Breakfast was excellent for a buffet and the pool is large. cons: The food options were limited and the food was generally underwhelming. Next time I would pay for the view (our room overlooked the parking lot). The rooms need a refresh - the two twin beds are not ideal (switch to Queen beds please!) and the chairs are stiff and plastic (they squeak when you sit or move in them). The tv turns on every time you walk in the room."

For some reason beach towels are left in the room; there is no way to return them after the beach and exchange them for clean ones. All the sand on the towels has to be carried through the entire hotel to the room"

Pool towels provided in rooms every day unlike other hotels where acquiring them involved deposit and daily trips to reception to change them . Reception staff were multilingual and very helpful and friendly. Morning buffet breakfast was excellent. The staff in the dining areas were fantastic...so efficient and friendly. cons: The evening buffet was more than adequate if you liked fish and meat but was not for me and I found that many of the salads also had fish / meat in them.!! I would have liked a larger more defined area designated to vegetarian options.  The reception area is not in the best location as there is a large pillar partially blocking the view of available receptionists. Could I suggest that you put a hand rail on the steps leading from back door to pool area. On two occasions I observed a person stumbling backwards going up the steps and likewise stumbling going down .

The views from the hotel were stunning and the landscaping was really impressive. They offer a happy hour everyday which helped on the price of drinks. Easy to get down to the beach and not overtaxing either. I saw some older couples taking a break but they have benches along the way for that reason with shade. Nice little restaurant down at the beach as well. The pool was clean and refreshing. The hotel room was as you would expect. Clean and great air con for a hot day. Shower was excellent - came with Ritual shower products. The staff were exceptional - so friendly and didn’t forget us. They had music every night but it was cheesy and not much of a vibe - more background music for late night drinks and for an older crowd but can’t complain as we weren’t looking for a wild time! location from airport was also a massive plus. Uber made everything very easy and affordable. Easy and cheap to get to Albufeira as well for an evening. Also had good activities for adults like pool and tennis (although had to pay extra for everything). cons: It was expensive for the drink and food on the property and the food quality could have been just a bit better but we were going for convenience of not leaving the property at lunchtime. It wasn’t horrible but also wasn’t incredibly happy spending 40€ on a subpar lunch.

The location is great too. And dont worry about the fact that the hotel doesnt have double beds. If you request ahead of time they can join the twin beds to make a really comfy queen size bed. We are definitely coming back! cons: The front desk staff are very polite but I think they can be a just a tiny bit more attentive to guests waiting to speak to them. But other than this very minor thing the staff are great!

The staff is very helpful. Good food provided at hotel restaurants. cons: The restaurants at the hotel didn’t have allergen menus and as I am lactose intolerant it was stressful ensuring that my food is safe for me to eat. I was once served an incorrect meal (the staff were very apologetic and didn’t charge for their mistake) but all could have been avoided if the information on what’s contained in each of the dishes was readily available.

The property was so beautifully planned out with so many lovely sitting areas and nice designs. The staff were all so happy and helpful. Really made us feel welcome. Was so sad to leave today and can’t wait to come back. cons: The rooms really need screen doors so that you can enjoy the cool evening ocean air without the addition of terrifying cockroaches flying in to say hello. We also wish we had been encouraged to book the spa before we came as we were really looking forward to treating ourselves but it was totally booked up. I was also disappointed that our shuttle taxi to the hotel was free but back to the airport it was €49. That was a bit of shock.

Breakfast was excellent.  The restaurant was good fresh fish and vegetables were tasty.  Waiting staff were friendly.  Overall the hotel was clean.  I liked using the gym although not all equipment worked well.  Did not use the pool but it looked great!! cons: I wanted to have a dessert and hot chocolate in the evening outside looking over the cliffs and beach where the seats and tables were but when I had asked about this at the Italian restaurant there seemed to be an issue with this.  They did allow me to do so reluctantly.  I returned my glass and dessert plate to the restaurant when I had finished but their initial reluctancy did ruin my quiet time when looking over the cliffs and beach.  I used the gym but not all the equipment worked properly.  On arrival to the hotel one member of staff at reception I found unfriendly.

We were very surprised by this and wouldn't recommend staying at this property if you're a family with young kids & teens.  Perhaps the summer stays are different (there is indeed a kids club) but but there were absolutely no other young adults on property during our stay - not so fun for the teens especially when other guests seem constantly annoyed by them.

Parking is free on the road and thestaff are very friendly and efficient. Our room was very nice with comfy beds a good shower and a balcony with fabulous views. We didn’t use the outdoor pool as the water felt quite cold but it is open all year and plenty of other people were enjoying a swim. The indoor pool and jacuzzi are warmer but small so they can be too crowded for comfort. Didn’t use the spa. The beach is stunning! Yes there is a flight of steps down from the hotel but these steps are sturdy and safe with little seats to rest on all the way.  The restaurant has good food with plenty of choice for every diet although I found the dinner buffet dishes  a bit over salted. The Italian bistro food was splendid but the lighting could do with being a bit more subtle and atmospheric. Happy hour in the bar (5-6pm) was fun - perhaps a bit too fun lol! Very well priced drinks which if you order carefully can keep you going until supper time! Would prefer not to have the football screen on constantly in that area - no one ever watched it! 
Traveller tip - We had a lovely time but we were staying out of season so the hotel was not full. Nonetheless it was surprisingly busy. Therefore I would think in peak holiday season it might be a bit overcrowded for comfort. cons: Leaf blower under our balcony at 7am one morning and badly behaved kids in the indoor pool and jacuzzi - the spa should be adults only. 
Traveller tip - in the restaurant walk to the far end to be seated as it is less crowded and quieter."

We like the staff and location particularly.  We always have a sea facing room too and pay extra for this. cons: This time we did have one thing that we didn't like.. . This related to the outdoor music near the Il Basilico restaurant.  The live music was VERY loud and everyone in the sea facing apartments would hear it.  The band plays for the restaurant but We didn't want to hear it but we were forced to close the window to drown the sound. The band either plays inside the restaurant or turns down the sound significantly if outside.. WHY NOT JUST PLAY PIPED MUSIC TO THE DINERS!

We did root out some good restaurants in the village . cons: A little tired ( decor in bedrooms and bathrooms needs redoing ) 
A little expensive too especially the attached Italian restaurant! The beach is fabulous but the village Oleos De Aqua doesn’t offer a lot ? Certainly not a pretty village but then some of Algarve coastal areas are a little unattractive.We really had to root around to find good restaurants but they are there .

Cliff-top views over the sea are amazing. Half board buffet offered a good selection of meat fish salads and desserts to most tastes.  Good breakfast.  Best place to dine is the veranda area for the ambiance. Beds were very comfortable for us. Family suite room was spacious. cons: Family suite room - 2 bedrooms common area 2 bathrooms no sea view tiny balcony - were a little tired and showing 15 years of use. Some of the power sockets did not work and the master bathroom needed some cosmetic improvement. Disappointing given the price and a 4-star hotel.  Also can't get tap water with dinner - all bottled water is charged.

Rooms were very clean and changed daily. Breakfast was fresh with great variety. Didn't spend much time round the pool.

Italian restaurant was fantastic but need to prebook to get a nice sea view. cons: The rooms don't let a lot of light in. This is fine at night but in the day it feels quote gloomy. Not the biggest problem as cannot imagine people spending a lot of time in the room in the day.

PortoBay Falesia,en-gb,2022-07-30,2022-07-31,couple,leisure,pl,4,1,2022-08-01 14:41:35,pros: We spent a weekend at the property. The hotel sits on the edge of a beautiful beach. It has its own swimming pool tennis courts and plenty of other places to spend time. We mainly had drinks. The staff speak many languages perfectly: Portuguese English French and German. It is a very lovely gesture to be able to use the pool and other facilities after check-out. We reached the hotel by bus the stop is 10 minutes from the main entrance.  I would recommend a stay at this property. cons: The only downside was the pizza in the restaurant I expected something better baked and tastier.

The buffet breakfasts and dinners were extensive beautifully presented and we couldn't fault it.  The lunches offered at the poolside Il Basilico as part of our full-board option - were again beautifully cooked and presented.  All of the staff at the hotel - particularly in the restaurants - are an absolute credit.  
Incredibly comfy beds plenty of sunbeds for all we loved the poolside live jazz music in the evenings and the clifftop setting and outdoor seating areas have exceptional views over the sea. cons: Our family suite was enormous.  The hotel decor is perhaps a little dated and could do with a refresh.  A few potted plants around the Reception area and more of a 'wow' factor in terms of bedrooms and decor throughout the hotel would turn this from 'really good' to 'amazing'.  However this didn't detract from our stay at all - beautiful setting comfy beds incredible food and friendly attentive staff made our stay thoroughly enjoyable."

Absolutely gorgeous region!  Food was good breakfast was fantastic and the cocktails were great. Lastly the staff were all super friendly and helpful. cons: The live music was terrible that could be improved upon. Also it took them a whole week to finally fix our toilet seat that was broken.  Could've given us a free drink for that hassle. Lastly housekeeping left their cleaning rag on my toiletry bag- was not happy about that although they all apologized and felt super bad about that.

You can choose between the pool area the garden and the beach. Our favorite spot was the terrasse overlooking the cliffs and the beach (also there are only three spots and except for the terrasse at the poolbar it's the only spot with a view).
There are two nice restaurants at the beach (not part of the ressort).
The breakfast is tasty and the staff manages to keep the buffett filled even in rush hour. cons: Few things:
Albufeira is a center of mass tourism. We had a rental car so we toured around and didn't mind. 

The prices for afternoon snacks/drinks at the pool are quite high - and too high if you compare it with average pricing in the region."

Also we weren’t lucky with our room view which was parking lot under the hotel building and other people’s rooms. It didn’t ruin our holiday but wasn’t the impression we got from the photos and hotel information.

Fantastic hotel spacious room clean comfortable beds very good breakfast nice pool and great surrounding. I really enjoyed our stay there and love to come back one day. cons: Either you drive for dinner to Santa Catarina or Tavira or you have to book up-front at the hotel. The second day of our stay we wanted to have dinner at the hotel asked about this during breakfast - all places were booked so we had to drive to the town to eat something. There are shifts for breakfast which has its pros and cons. We got up-grade for our room at the same price which was very nice and helpful (due to the fact that my husband is disabled the disabled rooms were occupied so we got a big family room instead). At the same time we could not use tea or coffee maker as in the regular room there were none same with water. I am very grateful for the up-grade but really this one tea or coffee or water is nothing in comparison to the hotel rates and would not make a difference for the hotel but made a huge difference in my perception of the service. Nevertheless it is a great place and I would come back definitely.

Large clean bathroom 
View of countryside from the room
Gorgeous shrubs and herbs in the garden -the lavender was spectacular 
Room & breakfast price -really good value cons: So disappointed with the dining experience. We were expecting something really special having read the reviews .The lovely fish meals on offer were only available if you ordered 24 hours before and as we only stayed 1 night this wasn’t an option. So  we had a limited menu and the only available fish was octopus which didn’t appeal . I settled for the vegan chickpea dish which was very tasty but not what I had in mind. Husband enjoyed the venison though the potatoe dish had a large amount of garlic in despite the waitress saying it would not be significant.Having made it clear that he didn’t like garlic  the olives appeared soaked in garlic. The waitress was very nice &  apologetic though. 
The restaurant itself is very clean but it had a cafeteria style with very hard chairs.I asked for a cushion but the answer was no.  Not cosy or romantic in any way. Bright lights no candles etc It seemed quite expensive for what we had but I think it was the overall experience that made me feel this way.
The bed was very hard but loved the room overall."

Tambien no hay sitio confortable y agradable para los adultos sentarem y hablaren.
Ademas despues de passar todo el dia fuera cuando volvi para la habitacion esta no estaba limpia (17:00) y cuando fui reclamar la respuesta fue que ellos tienen hasta las 18:30 para hacerlo. Al final la limpieza fue hecha cuando mis hijos estaban en la ducha.
Por fin la persona de la recepcion no ha podido darnos ninguna informacion sobre que hacer en los alrededores.
Para mi es un ""bed and breakfast"" con una buena cena."

Jardins bem arranjados e recantos muito bonitos localização permite deslocação para a praia e cidade de Tavira. Hotel tem vários livros ao dispor dos hóspedes e alguns animais que fazem a delícia das crianças. cons: Apesar de ser uma unidade de turismo rural onde se ambiciona mais sossego e tranquilidade do que noutros hotéis tivemos uma festa de aniversário de pessoas externas ao hotel que durou uma tarde inteira com música e barulho. Não era o que esperávamos deste tipo de alojamento. Ou são um espaço de eventos ou de turismo rural ambos não é possível. Pequeno almoço merece mais atenção e mais produtos regionais.

Pagué 415 € por un fin de semana más de 200 € por noche! Y era como pasar un día en una piscina municipal. Lleno de niños gritando corriendo en la habitación de arriba desde las 7 de la mañana. Si llamas a recepción nunca lo cogen el Spa usado de trastero hasta con un congelador enmedio y apagado a pesar de que avisamos. Te dan a elegir hora del desayuno lo que no te dicen es que si eliges a las 10 no queda ni mantequilla. De verdad un robo

I have been highly impressed each time I have stayed here. The breakfast is excellent with a wide variety of choice. The hotel is in a lovely rural setting and is very peaceful and tranquil but at the same time is only a 10-20 min drive away from Olhao and Faro and access to local beaches.
Each time I have visited I have found the staff to be very friendly and welcoming.

The buffet continental breakfast was varied and catered for all tastes. The hotel allowed guests to have breakfast outdoors by the pool and that was really nice. cons: I cannot think of anything that was unpleasant - perhaps a lift in the main hotel building for elderly or disabled guests would make a difference for guests with mobility issues. Although the hotel has only one floor it can pose a challenge for these guests to access their rooms in the main hotel building.

The staff are friendly and helpful and the entire ambience of the place is peaceful and tranquil. The rooms are large and well equipped. cons: The pool sunbeds are worn out uncomfortable and need replacing. A safety issue we have mentioned before is the need for a non slip bath mat for use whilst showering to prevent an avoidable fall. The food in the restaurant has noticeably deteriorated since our last visit. Chicken dishes were tough and unpleasant and the sirloin steak was inedible. We did complain about this to the waiter but did not get any feedback. This is potentially a major issue as the hotel is quite isolated and guests rely on having decent food in the hotel restaurant.

Beds were also made every day! This was an unexpected bonus! The surrounding area within the hotel grounds was top class and our apartment overlooked the croquet lawn with the local ducks feeding by the waters edge. The staff including the owner went out of their way to help in any way that they could. The food in the hotel was excellent along with a good selection of local wines and beers. In my opinion this hotel is the ""Jewel in the Crown"" in the eastern Algarve an area that we have visited for the last 25 years but not at this venue. There is no doubt that we will return this year. cons: There is no downside to this accommodation!"

They were very accommodating when Ryanair cancelled our flight:they managed to allow us to stay in the same room for an extra night at the same daily rate. The room was very clean on arrival and kept like that by the cleaner. Breakfast was good but like any hotel breakfast gets a bit samey after about three days. Similarly the evening meal at a set menu cost of 20euros whilst good value was a bit lacking in imagination and I wouldn't want to eat there every night. There were plenty of sun loungers when we were there (very beginning of June 2023). cons: I should have gone to reception with my pillow and asked for a better one: it was way past its' shelf life! As I said breakfast like any hotel was a bit repetitive. The sun loungers could have been more padded and it would have been wonderful to have had a heated pool but I understand this is rare in early June.

Beautiful setting for a quiet and relaxing holiday in a spacious apartment set in peaceful grounds to wander around and enjoy watching the duck family and terrapins. The apartment was spotlessly clean and comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The lovely town of Olhao is only 10 minutes by car. cons: Nothing to dislike everything perfect! A car is essential for exploring the area.

The cameras is worth a lot but the memory card held irreplaceable wonderful memories of my visit to the Algarve and other places in beautiful Portugal. cons:

It’s such a nice place at the roof top that it should be allowed to stay until 11 or 12pm of course respecting rules of minimum noise.

Hotel Marina Rio,en-us,2023-09-22,2023-09-24,couple,leisure,us,4,2,2023-09-29 19:55:11,pros: The room was beautifully furnished and very clean. Not uncommon for Europe also fairly compact and there was only one occasional chair so one of us had to sit on the bed. Our room faced the bus station so while the view wasn't noteworthy our room was quiet. Very modern amenities and a beautiful rooftop terrace that faces the marina. The bathroom has a huge soaking tub heavenly after a long day of walking. Very friendly helpful staff. The location great in that it faces the marina but the beach is a 15-20 minute walk just something to keep in mind depending on what one is bringing/if you have children. cons: The hotel is very secure because ones room card is necessary to open the elevator door in addition to the room. But it also must remain in the slot by the door to keep everything electrical in the room running. Great for conservation but not for climate control as the a/c (or heat) goes off when the card is removed. Our room was quite warm when we returned to it the first day and it took a while to get comfortable again. Because there were two of us we subsequently left one key card in the slot when we left so the a/c would remain on. The hotel offers breakfast but at 12.50 euro per person per day we opted not to take advantage. A bit pricey. In fairness I don't know what was offered so it might have been incredible but we aren't huge breakfast eaters so it was an easy decision.

This was consistent throughout our stay. An amazing person and a credit to the hotel business.
Rooms were of very high quality including the beautiful softness of the bed linen and the balcony was to a very high finish/maintenance quality. Unbelievably relaxing atmosphere. Coffee machine in room was fantastic and croissants in your restaurant were delicious.
Loved it. cons: (1) No access to the back of the TV for streaming. This is very unusual now in most hotels. 
Recommendation: An hotel note could be left in room to allow pick-up of the required cable at Reception (with a required deposit to ensure return). We had our laptops but it wasn’t the same and unfortunately just for this reason alone we couldn’t return or recommend. 
(2) A bit of a bad/ugly smell was present in our room after cleaning was carried out on our 2nd day. Smelled as if cleaning cloths were not sanitised correctly. It was gone after about 20 minutes with door open to balcony. We waited on the balcony for the 20 minutes until bad smell was gone.
Bed sheets not changed on 2nd day and not shaken out correctly - there were crumbs/particles of dirt and small stain still present on the sheet on the 2nd evening. Disappointed with this."

We would have paid extra to move or ask for front facing room initially should we have been made aware. 
When you are on holiday you don't want to be up at 5 am because of the noise. And that is what we have experienced. 
The staff member should have been polite about it but instead the lady was rude and not wanting to listen. In despite of the hotel itself which we like unfortunately we will not stay there again."

The staff should warn the guest that the adjacent parking lot does not belong to the Hotel and it is constantly monitored by the police it is like a trap.

I would definitely stay here again. cons: There's nothing I didn't like as I would stay here again.  But I booked a standard room which faced the back of the hotel and my terrace looked out the bus parking lot directly in back of the hotel.  It was not noisy at all but if you don't want to look at a parking lot full of buses I would book a marina view.

One of our rooms faced the bus stop but we knew that ahead of time from photos and reviews so didn’t mind. Just be aware! :)"

I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others. Espresso machine in the room in addition to standard kettle. cons:

It is situated right if front of the marina where you can book tours and have access to many restaurants and bars.  The beach is a 15 minute walk.

The room was just a right size.  The bed was really comfortable and the balcony was really nice.  There was no issues with hot water or AC.  The breakfast was really good and had many choices.  You can even make arrangement for breakfast if you have to leave early which was really nice of them. There is a lift for our convenience. The staff was really friendly and helpful. They do have parking but very limited so don't forget to reserve your space.  I woud recommend this hotel to anyone. cons:

The supermarket Pingo Douche is a short walk away. Breakfast is good and the variety is fine. It is not rocket science but works well. The cleaning is superb you can not fault it. The showers are to die for there is so much space. All the essentials are supplied and there is even a towel warmer. Mini fridge is great and safety deposit box is free along with air con. The staff are so nice and my thanks goes out to Isabel for booking me a taxi to and from the airport. We stayed in room 201 and it was great. The sun sets behind the hotel but it is lovely sitting in the late afternoon on the balcony watching the world boats go by. The pool is on the 4th floor and is small but is a bonus. The lounger area opposite is a must for all those who want to watch the world go by. cons: Breakfast could be a little different and the reception area seemed to lack a bit of panache. It works but need something to liven it up.

Her manner continued to be unpleasant and she did not apologize for her mistake.
Hotel Marina Rio,en-us,2022-04-26,2022-04-27,couple,leisure,us,4,1,2022-05-01 17:38:46,pros: We had a wonderful time in our one night visit to Lagos starting with great suggestions from Isabel at the front desk as to where to eat and what to do.  We were able to park in the very convenient outdoor lot alongside the hotel for just 3 Euros/day. The room was very nice with a balcony with table and chairs overlooking the marina.  The beds were very comfortable. Front desk staff was fluent in English and attentive to our needs even providing bandaids right away for a cut finger.  We didn’t make use of it but the front desk also handles a nice bar area downstairs that other guests were enjoying. cons: Nothing. It was great!
Hotel Marina Rio,en-us,2022-04-26,2022-04-29,couple,leisure,us,4,3,2022-04-30 10:11:33,pros: The property is very well located being across the street from the marina (access to various boat trips) and at the north end of the typical walking tour to see the old town and main historic sights. We had a river-facing room and recommend that even though there is more traffic noise (with the balcony door open). Breakfast was excellent with both healthy and diverse fare. Jorge at the front desk was both friendly and helpful throughout our stay. It’s nice to experience a good sense of humor across languages. cons: The only negative which was not very negative at all was the parking. There is an adjacent lot that costs 3 euros per day (9:00 am to 7:00 pm strictly enforced) and spaces across the street that cost the same for a 24-hour period (also strictly enforced). We were there in late-April and parking was reasonably plentiful but I expect the same will not be true during peak season. If you don’t pay for parking by the daily deadline you should expect a 5 euro ticket under your wiper blade.

They serve a wonderful breakfast with eggs cooked to order. All the rooms have a balcony with a table and two chairs. We opted for a room with a harbor view as other rooms in the back of the hotel overlook the surrounding buildings and a bus parking lot. The hotel has a pool and terrace located on the top floor which we enjoyed. There is pay parking for 3 euros next door but there are two free parking spaces in front which we were lucky to be able to use. The train station is also within walking distance. We would recommend! cons:

Tea and coffee making facilities provided also dressing gowns and slippers.  No glitches with the wi-fi.  The hotel is conveniently situated a few few minutes flat walk from the centre but far enough away for easy parking. cons: There was a low humming noise in the background which was only noticeable in the quiet of the night.  Our room was on the third floor and perhaps it came from the pump for the rooftop swimming pool above?

We had a lovely view over the Marina. cons: This hotel is rated as 4 stars but please be aware it has no restaurant for lunch or dinner or even a snack or coffee during the day. There is a very small pool on the roof but not really suitable for sunbathing as it is very windy. A few sun beds on a different part of roof but little or no atmosphere.  Also there is a tiny bar if you want a drink in the evening you go to reception and they get it for you.  Breakfast area very small you are literally bumping into other guests trying to get breakfast. Also not a lot of choice. One member of staff to clean tables restock and seat guests.

View from rooftop is good but very windy to enjoying (in June). cons: The view for standard rooms is a bus station. Marina view is extra €70 per night which then makes it expensive compared to other places which are closer to the town with a view (this is a 10 min walk which is long when it’s hot). Bright light outside shines in during the night. The bedding is not 4* quality lumpy pillows.

La ubicación también es muy buena enfrente de la marina y a 5 minutos del centro. La piscina es pequeña pero suficiente. El ambiente es tranquilo. cons: Nada. El mayor “inconveniente” que tuvimos fue que un día se nos colaron 4 o 5 hormigas en la habitación y en seguida subieron a “fumigarlas” (lo pongo entre comillas porque para la cantidad que había no hacía ni falta) y al día siguiente nos hicieron limpieza intensiva y no se volvió a ver una.

Quarto limpo e bonito. A vista para a Marina é melhor. cons: Não gostamos do chuveiro e do box aberto. O ralo não dava vazão e inundava o banheiro.
Local do café da manhã pequeno não comportando a todos e com uma funcionária sobrecarregada correndo pra lá e pra cá."

Es un hotel correcto. cons: El personal encontramos que tenia mala disposición. El día que llegamos lo hicimos cerca de las 13:15 horas al entrar para ver el tema del estacionamiento lo primero que nos dicen es que el check in es a las 14:00 lo cual lo teníamos claro luego de poder finalmente aparcar llegamos con las maletas y la persona de recepción nos queda mirando y le digo que tenemos una reserva y me dice: el check in es a las 14:00 (segunda vez). Y ahí le pregunté si nos podía hacer el ingreso por mientras que esperábamos los 40 minutos restantes y lo hizo pero de mala gana. Y asi cómo eso pasaron otros temas por lo que en definitiva deberían mejorar su servicio al cliente poco cálido y muy transaccional. Nos pareció caro para lo que ofrecen. Considerar que al centro son unos 10 minutos caminando.

Funcionários muito simpáticos e atentos. Bom pequeno almoço com muita variedade. cons: Hotel sem estacionamento. Um pouco caro para as comodidades oferecidas e para o tipo de hotel. Mas...é no Algarve.

Spotless and modern rooms and facilities. Staff were friendly and accommodating went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. cons: Maybe it would’ve been nice to have a kettle or coffee making facilities in the room (they do supply them at reception though). As it was off- season the hotel was very quiet so sometimes there wasn’t always someone in the bar/restaurant to get drinks.
Vila Gale Collection Praia,en-gb,2024-11-01,2024-11-02,couple,leisure,gb,4,1,2024-11-04 15:40:55,pros: Beautiful room in a lovely hotel very close to the beach with use of the spa and wellness centre. There was a surprise bottle of sparkling wine and water in the room. cons: No coffee/tea facilities in the bedroom
Vila Gale Collection Praia,en-gb,2024-10-26,2024-10-30,couple,leisure,ie,4,4,2024-10-30 22:10:18,"pros: Great hotel only 40 rooms so feels like you’ve the place to yourself. Staff are lovely and nothing is too much trouble. Room over looking the pool was great good size and all you need. The spa includes free access to jacuzzi sauna and steam room and I would highly recommend getting a massage (prices are not too bad)! There’s a chill out area which pool table and cocktails from the bar are fab! Location is great 3 mins walk to the beach which you pass a fab Italian restaurant and on the beach there are a few bars the one on the right we had a great fish meal in one of the nights. If you are looking for something a little more peaceful then this is your spot. We got a Uber into Albufeira one of the nights and was so glad we were staying out of that madness. cons: The bed had a mattress protector made of plastic so when you moved it made noise and was not comfortable as we were roasting with it but easy solution just remove it and remake the bed. Breakfast options were lovely and tasty but limited so after a few days we were a little bored with it perhaps maybe it could be changed up each day? 

Two very small things which would not stop me from recommending this place!"

Vila Gale Collection Praia,en-gb,2024-09-06,2024-09-09,couple,leisure,gb,4,3,2024-10-24 17:27:16,pros: Staff were so lovely and accommodating. We were there for our anniversary and they'd surprised us with a bottle of delicious champagne. The hotel is clean shiny and quiet. Don't bother with local restaurants because the one here is exceptional. The pool and spa feels secluded and a treat. And then you go down the road to reach the beach and sea. Felt like the escape we needed. cons: We probably couldn't have done longer than 3 or 4 days just because there's not too much to do in the surrounding area. It would have also have been nice to have a coffee machine/kettle in the room already and not have to pay for milk.

Vila Gale Collection Praia,en-gb,2024-09-27,2024-10-01,couple,leisure,gb,4,4,2024-10-06 10:06:47,pros: Hotel is is a quiet location which was perfect. Long strip of a beach you can walk. 3 lovely restaurants on the beach and a few more next to the hotel. you won’t feel you need to go to another town to eat. Best sunset and seafood. hotel is boutique comfortable room clean and spacious. Staff is lovely. Grounds of the pool area is beautiful. Plenty of sun beds. There is also indoor hot water big jacuzzi and steam room sauna. Overall it’s a lovely hotel to relax and enjoy the warm weather. It’s not on the beach but literally less than a min walk to it. sun beds on the beach are  for couple 10 Euro. I recommend to use the beach behind the first restaurant on the left. More secluded and quiet. And that restaurant has a bar upstairs. It’s the best spot to watch glorious sun set whilst you sip your delicious cocktails with lounge music. Just lovely. cons: Everything was great

The size of the hotel meant it was quiet during the day and we always were able to get a pair of loungers by the pool. cons: Whilst the included breakfast was good the “cooked breakfast” elements (bacon sausage beans etc.) were cold each morning.

The breakfast set up and selection is great.
Made use of the spa and it was lovely especially the facials! Left my face super smooth. The best part was I had a surprise from the hotel where on my birthday I was out and came back to a lovely chocolate cake and a bottle of wine for me to celebrate my birthday. The best part was I didn’t tell them but they must have noticed when I checked in and they decided to be intentional. Now that was the highlight of my stay. Can’t thank the staff enough for making my stay here a wonderful one. Highly recommended!!! cons: "
Vila Gale Collection Praia,en-gb,2024-08-11,2024-08-15,couple,leisure,gb,4,4,2024-08-19 18:51:17,"pros: This hotel is beautiful the gardens and pool area are immaculate with plenty of space and always a comfy sunbed no matter what time of day it is.  The staff are very attentive professional and friendly.  Breakfast was delicious with a good choice of hot and cold and cava! and there is a lovely restaurant for dinner and a pizza restaurant next door. The rooms are extremely clean and big our bed was huge and so comfy!  The shower was very powerful and big bath sheets!  The resort is very quiet but the beach is just down the road with 3 restaurants/bars.  We also found an Indian Seafood and Chinese restaurant about a ten/fifteen minute walk inland.  I would recommend this hotel 100% and would definitely go again! cons: The pillows were lumpy and I wish I'd asked to replace them.
Booking.com advertised a free taxi to this hotel but never included details of how to book and then denied it when I messaged them."

The check in at Gale was absolutely 💯- Louisa was very attentive and informative. We were delighted to come to our room and find some bubbly and chocolate strawberries after telling her we were celebrating something special. This is a very quiet resort and great for couples. cons: We were a little disappointed that they charge to use the tennis court on site as well as renting rackets and balls. It seemed a bit tacky considering the level of service at the hotel- it was right behind the pool and not used at all by anyone during our 3 day stay.

They cannot do enough for you and no request is too much hassle. We had our birthdays here and would highly recommend anyone wanting to have that extra personal touch to do the same.

The food at breakfast was delicious as was the evening restaurant menu and we had very attentive service. The spa facilities were perfect relaxing and treatments reasonably priced for the value given. 

The area is quiet so you can hear the ocean waves from the balcony and the hotel is just a 5 minute walk to the beach. Both check in and check out were seemless. 

Unlike other hotels I've stayed at the management here were keen to understand how they could do even more in future to make a stay at the hotel better and took time to meet us and ask for our suggestions. This was a simple but effective idea and I hope to come back in future to see what has developed. cons: The gym was a little small and under equipped there could have been better use of the library/pool table area and the pictures of the yoga stance people on the wall in the restaurant seemed out of place but minor things overall."

Also the clock in the gym was broken and only a jug of tap water to drink and no gym towels. We were there 4 nights and complained about the cardio machine the first day but they did not fix it while we were there. Also the Jacuzzi had no stairs to get in/out so we could not use it and we are middle-aged but not retirement age. Finally we parked ok on the street but the hotel has no parking so I would not come here with a car during high season (summer)."

Not automatic. I did not like the carpeting in the rooms…looked dirty and Idont understand why they don’t have wood or tile floors. We were on the non pool side of the building and the property next door started working very early in the morning using a loud machine. However I am sure if we were staying a second night the hotel would have made an effort to move us. We only stayed one night so didn’t bother to discuss it with reception.

Staff left us strawberries and wine as a honeymoon gift. Great location for the beach. Manager is pleasant and happy to talk about future improvements and plans for the Hotel. He encouraged us to voice any issues when they happen so if you do go - please do tell the staff directly if you have a problem with tough food or room as they like constructive criticism straight away. cons: food was really not to expected standard coffee in the morning was horrible if you want something and can’t see it on the menu ask as they usually have something you want but don’t like to advertise it...they need much better veggie options. lack of consistency in lunch bar food quality - came out cold chips and small portions then the next day big portions and hot - not good quality meat - greasy or tough. coffee machines need nespresso capsules - it is cheaper to bring your own because they charge you a few euro per pod. Breakfast food is ok in selection but the hot food is tasteless and greasy in the buffet continental option could include more like cucumber olives fish. 
If you are a foodie it is disappointing. We ate out most evenings although we went to pizzeria down the road which was soggy pizza and absent staff - turned out it is owned by hotel. 
if you like food then we recommend the restaurant by the roundabout on the sea front for good food and beautiful views . 
Apart from food and coffee quality - we loved the hotel and would definitely return if the food quality improves."

Boas comodidades. cons: Muitos dos hóspedes fazem reservas de espreguiçadeiras na piscina com toalhas e o hotel não tem funcionários capazes de evitar que tal aconteça (como existe em outros hotéis em que se recolhem as toalhas que estejam a marcar espreguiçadeiras). Falámos na recepção mas não puderam fazer nada. Só conseguimos ir à piscina 1x em 5 dias pois das outras ocasiões estava sempre cheia (quando na verdade estava vazia). 
O serviço de limpeza de quartos foi quase sempre muito tardio (depois da hora de almoço) o que acaba por condicionar caso se queira descansar um pouco no quarto ao final da manhã ou depois de almoço.
Apesar de existir algum estacionamento público na rua em época alta é complicado estacionar pois estacionamento público é ocupado pelas pessoas que vão à praia. Para um hotel nestes valores teria que existir uma alternativa de modo a garantir estacionamento para os hóspedes."

Quanto ao quarto este apresenta-se espaçoso embora a casa de banho tenha dimensões menores do que a média para a sua categoria. O AC funciona de forma silencioso e efectiva. cons: Por ter sido durante a época baixa o pequeno almoço não era na modalidade buffet e o serviço deixou algo a desejar em termos de qualidade e confecção.

La habitación y el baño son muy espaciosos quizás el baño podría modernizarse.

I don’t know if she thought I wasn’t a guest there or what the issue was but she turns to another guy and he’s like yeah she can sit anywhere. She takes me to the table and asks my room number (which they didn’t ask anyone else that while I sat there) then comes back and was much nicer.

3HB Faro,en-gb,2024-05-15,2024-05-18,couple,leisure,gb,4,3,2024-06-15 01:06:54,"pros: This hotel is fantastic. From arrival to when we left this was a 5 star experience.

The location is excellent right in the heart of faro in the old town you can explore the landmarks and there are walking tours online that you can follow to explore. One day we took the ferry to the beach through the lagoon ferry stop is 5 mins walk would strongly recommend.

Rooms - Immaculate and decorated to an extremely high standard lots of space and well finished with nice lighting. Copper effect fixtures in the bathroom rainforest shower lovely toiletries. The bed was a dream to sleep in so comfortable. Plenty of bottled water restocked every day and during the day if you use it. It also seemed like whenever we left the room consumables would be checked and topped up fantastic service.

Facilities - Excellent. The indoor spa is great with steam room sauna and different showers (cold rainforest mist). The pool is a nice size and has integrated jacuzzi areas to stand and sit in. They’ve crammed a lot into a moderate sized space and done it to a very high standard. Nice sun-bed area to relax too. The spa area is free to residents.

The outdoor pool area is also very nice rooftop infinity pool with lovely views sunbeds and seats and you can get snacks and drinks brought to you. There weren’t enough sunbeds for number of guests personally I’d swap out some seats for loungers.

We couldn’t get late check out but were offered to leave bags at reception and there are two private shower facilities in the reception area we were really impressed with this just shows attention to a great customer experience.

Staff - All were excellent welcoming and attentive. From a great warm welcome at reception and then helpful reception staff throughout. The housekeeping was amazing so much attention to detail. The staff in the bar/restaurant were particularly good making up off menu cocktails for us (mainly French 75’s) and always really friendly and helpful. cons: "

Sound insulation meant the hotel was quiet even though we were in the centre of town. The staff were very responsive and fixed a couple of small maintenance issues with the room quickly and efficiently. cons: There was nothing we disliked. Having some lighter food options on the roof terrace in the evening would have made the area easier to use rather than having to order a full meal.

The staff were very friendly and helpful; the only thing I didn't like was that each morning they made you wait for a long time before allocating you a table. You cannot enter the breakfast dining area before giving your room number and often times the entrance was staffless which made it slower than necessary. 

The bedroom beds were exceptionally comfortable with high quality cotton bed linen and great towels slippers and robes provided :) cons: The rooftop pool was very small and ice cold. The indoor spa pool was also cold very small and full of children. I booked this holiday to be able to swim daily for health but the pools were too small to do laps in and very cold. 

I ordered a bowl of ice cream  on the rooftop bar and inquired about the pricing I asked for a menu she said Ice cream was not on the menu— I asked whether it was priced by the bowl or by the scoop. The server informed me it was by the bowl. When I asked how many scoops were included in a bowl she responded ""As many as you want.""

Feeling perplexed by the vague response I decided to order three scoops of ice cream. To my surprise I was charged £4.50 per scoop making it the most expensive ice cream I have ever had in my life at £13.50 for a bowl. Be careful on the rooftop everything is overpriced and they are sometimes forgetful to give you menus with prices."

The hotel was in a very good situatoon to explire tge old town and go on boat trips to the islands and very nesr to Faro airport.

 There was a good choice of food for the buffet breakfast or we could order omelettes or poached eggs etc to be cooked to order. There was a fantastic view over Faro from the rooftop and we enjoyed swimming in the rooftop pool and sitting up there and had lunch outside the rooftop cafe. We also went to the downstairs restaurant twice and enjoyed the food. When it was my birthday we were given free desserts and sparkling wine. 

All the staff were friendly and helpful and our room was kept spotlessly clean. The receptionists ordered a taxi to take us to the airport. We would definitely stay again and recommend it to friends. cons: The plates were cold and the food could have been hotter for breakfast and the rooftop cafe. The food and plates in the downstairs restaurant were hot. The hotel was quite expensive but probably worth it for the luxury."

Situated right in the city centre it provides easy access to the whole region. The rooms are high quality cleaned daily. There is free water and Coca Cola delivered daily to the room by the lovely staff and no mini bar to tempt travellers. The beds are very large and both the beds and the pillows are super comfortable the best I’ve ever slept in a hotel. Fantastic shower and modern bathroom. Rooms are a good size with plenty of storage space. Having stayed across 3 rooms (there were 6 of us) the views were all different and although not amazing views they were still good. We requested 3x twin rooms which they confirmed were guaranteed but because the twin beds are right next to each and cannot be moved apart (why?!) the staff were kind enough to proactively upgrade one of our rooms to a larger room (for free) enabling 2 of our party (who were friends not partners) to be comfortable by one on the beds and the other on the large and comfy sofa bed. The breakfast is amazing with fresh wide choice available and free a la carte options. The rooftop infinity pool is refreshing with clear views across the city plenty of seats and really tasty and generous lunch and snacks available (although they are pricey). The indoor pool and spa (all included) are excellent quality and very comfortable. We would stay here again definitely. cons: The twin beds should not be bolted together and should be movable. Out of 3 rooms only 2 had a balcony.

Staff are pretty great overall. 
Rooms are stunning with really comfortable beds good size and a balcony. 
Great to have a rooftop pool for chilling out during the day as there’s f’all to do in Faro.. so you’ll be glad to relax at this hotel for most of your stay. cons: The pool bar staff make average cocktails. Given the 5-hotel status and cost of cocktails they should invest in the best cocktail maker in Faro. 
Unfortunately some guests ignore the “don’t leave your towel on daybeds to reserve” sign and on a sunny day you can expect people to do just this. This meant many other guests including ourselves were seated in chairs watching empty sun loungers with their ‘owners’ sitting 20m away at the cafe having lunch. Poor form - all British tourists."

And that was the case here! 
I don't know the names but to everyone who was on duty at breakfast in the morning: thank you for making breakfast my most favorite time of the day! 
The location in the old town couldn't be better the room was top and the decor of the hotel warm and peaceful. And it smells so good ;) 
The location in the heart of the old town makes parking challenging but a good solution has been found in the nearby parking garage and a tuktuk that helps you transport the luggage. cons: A fee more shaded areas at the pool would be nice. 
The hotel is quite pricey but if it doesn't get more expensive it's worth the price."

Good breakfast options spa and a very relaxing massage. The rooftop is a bit crowded during the day but lovely for after dinner drinks in the breeze with a view on the city. Ricardo at the concierge desk was fabulous giving tips on all Algarve. cons: The beds are terribly soft we woke up with a back ache. The next morning we asked front desk if they could do something and they said they'd check with housekeeping. We came back at 7 pm and they hadn't done anything because before taking the topper off they wanted to ask me. So I said never mind I was not going to check after dinner and have housekeeping in the room late at night rearranging the bed. They should have done it in the morning. My other complaint being a smoker is that they should state the whole hotel is non smoking. Private room balconies too. Since smoking is allowed only on the highest part of the rooftop or outside the hotel maybe a 5 star hotel should consider adding a couple of couches just outside the entrance which is private and has lots of space.

We had the suite with King size bed which was perfect for my husband our 8 month old and myself. They also had already set up a pack and play/ crib for the baby. 

The room had two balconies a kitchenette with sink (perfect for washing bottles) and a mini fridge and microwave. 

Breakfast was complimentary and DELICIOUS. Also enjoyed both the Portuguese and Italian restaurant. The food is a bit on the pricey side but the price reflects the quality of the hotel. 

The roof top pool was also gorgeous! Even though it was pretty busy it was very quiet and enjoyable. Our son loved to sit on the side plash the water around. 

The location of the hotel is also great. Less than 15 minutes from the airport super convenient. It is right in the center of Faro a few minutes from the marina and has a good selection of restaurants shops cafes small grocery stores and pharmacies right around the corner. cons: The indoor pool was cold even though it was advertised as being a warm pool and the sauna was out of order!"

So friendly and professional. Someone took us up to our room with our bags they offered us a shower and changing room when early-check-in was not available yet and we were able to use the pool & facilities until our room was ready. Staff all so friendly! Also the gym was one of the best hotel-gyms I've been to: Good amount of space weights and cardio equipment floor mats and a few cable-machine equipment things to workout your whole body. Pool area was fabulous as well but could use more lay-down lounge chairs (they always get snatched early). cons: Pool area was fabulous but could use more lay-down lounge chairs (they always get snatched early) and at least heat the pool a bit - no one could be in there for longer than a few minutes because you would start shivering it's so cold.

Coffee wasn't from a machine either was actually ordered to the waiter & brought to you! cons: Not much to complain about - if anything pool was quite cold couldn't stay in it longer than a few minutes just to cool off from the heat of sunbathing.

Clean rooms with nice big beds. Really great breakfast. The location is overall very nice and welcoming. We visited in the off season and could think that somethings would be closed or a little slower due to season but it was not which was very nice. cons: Rooms looks a little old. Hooks in bathroom barely holding onto the wall anymore. electrical sockets very loose in the walls. The bathroom is semi-open and there is no ventilation so the room can feel moist and get a funky smell. A/C very noisy and not effecient. The pool/pool area could do with some more cleaning. The evening restaurant delivered the worst and most expensive meal on our holiday."

We had a little hiccup with our room and they went above and beyond to not only rectify it but more than make up for it. We are now huge fans and will always return to this hotel when we go to the Algarve. The location is fantastic the views amazing and the spa was super. We loved everything. cons: The buffet wasn’t fine dining but the breakfast team made up for it.

on the whole this hotel ticks every box. the staff are certainly the best part of it. always helpful and attentive. the rooms are spotless. the changing of the rooms was done perfectly and the staff were always accommodating. we received a welcome note and a gift and a little bottle of orange juice for our child which i thought was a lovely touch to include her. it was very much appreciated.
 i love coming to this hotel. the mock beach is also one one my favorite parts. the grounds are idyllic and the location so quiet and calm. you have access to the harbour and hotel is on the quiet end of the harbour. its very family friendly. would love to see some evening entertainment for children.. just a suggestion..  
there are 3 pools and one is heated... and there is a lifeguard on duty which was great to see.
we loved chatting to the birdman (IYKYK) and overall this is a super holiday / hotel destination. cons: the buffet is too expensive. eating at the hotel buffet as a family with a toddler is seen as an easier option rather than going out. more relaxing for the parents.... however my toddler (3 years old) would eat very little and not much variety. so the charge on her of €20 is way too much. and because the charge for us @ €40 each is also a lot together one dinner now costs €100. generally i felt overall the hotel food was too expensive.
please consider removing / reducing the plant based options from the menu. most plant based food and its ingredients if produced in a factory is actually highly processed food.  its full of oils and additives and preservatives especially plant based cheese. offer it as an alternative swap out for those that want to eat it but too much of the menu was planned around it."

Our room had a very big balcony with sun beds facing to the main gardenw where we we saw beautiful mornings and evenings sky every day!
The breakfast buffet has a quiet range of food and especially the fruits are so fresh and juicy. We tried the dinner buffet once the it was also very delicious.

Rooms very luxurious breakfast lovely and fresh. 
Arrangement of the bedroom- having the toilet separate to the bathroom is a genius idea. cons: Diffuser smell in reception was quite strong and it would be good to note which water in the rooms is complimentary vs which is paid for. 
The water spa had quite a few jets that didn’t work as well as one of the steam rooms which was rather disappointing. 
It’s also a bit of a walk from inside the hotel to the beach or marina itself-  simply because the grounds are so vast. Not a negative just good to know!"

The sun chairs were lined out to close to the person next to you a bit like sardines.

The rooms are spacious the pools are heated the staff are all helpful and friendly. The beds are very comfortable and the sheets get changed every day. We also did half board and were impressed by the quality and variety of food we didn’t get bored even after a week. Use of the spa is complementary and is a good size with everything you’d expect. Everything has been thought of already from little things like chocolates appearing on the bedside table before bed to pool services providing as many towels as you need right by the sun loungers. You can charge everything to your room so you don’t need to take anything with you except your room key. The location is an easy walk to the Vilamoura marina if you’re after some nightlife/cheaper cocktails. Albufeira and Quarteira are within very easy reach by car (although we did walk to Quarteria through the marina/beach a couple of times. An Uber back was €5). We also did the tasting menu at Makris on the Lake which was amazing; getting the wine flight is a must! It will run to €200pp but for a special occasion it’s worth doing. I really can’t emphasise enough how good the staff were you really got the feeling nothing would be too much trouble and the high level of customer service really sets this place apart even more so than the facilities or quality of the food. cons: Being very nitpicky a couple of times there was a wait queuing up to get into breakfast but it ran from 07:00-11:00 so there was no rush.

It was lovely then but under the Domes brand ownership it has been renovated and improved. The buildings rooms pools and grounds are beautifully maintained and spotlessly clean. The staff are all lovely cheerful friendly and helpful and the food is superb throughout the resort. The location at Vilamoura close to the beach and marina not far from Faro is excellent. It is an elegant resort. The Lake Resort is our happy place we will certainly return in future. cons: There is nothing at The Lake Resort we don’t like.

We were due to stay in Albufiera this time but after a noisy night we booked to stay at Domes Lake Algarve. We are so glad we made this change the staff could not have been more lovely and accommodating. We went for a delicious lunch at the hotels beach restaurant whilst we waited for our room to be ready and then found we had been upgraded to a suite. The room was stunning we had a luxious bath two balconies and the bed was so comfortable.
We loved everything about the hotel from the beautiful pool with sand to the Molton Brown toiletries to the lovely breakfast.  I would definitely recommend a spa day we both had a massage and the hot stone massage was the best I've experienced.
It's a lovely atmosphere in the hotel the staff cannot do enough for you (they even rescued my swimsuit after it fell onto the balcony below us) excellent food and a nice family atmosphere as well as suitable for couples.
The location is the cherry on top especially if you love seafood as the Marina is a short five minute walk. 
We will definitely be returning and we can't wait to return as a family once we've expanded our family.
Thank you for a relaxing fabulous stay! cons: "

we were treated to a gift in our room of a lovely bottle of Champagne and chocolates and spent most of our four days by the pool which is special. it has sand and is so warm. plenty of space to find a bed and a bar and restaurant open during the day. one day there was even coffee cocktails from a little stall for free which was a nice touch. so many great things to mention but don't have space. but really the staff were so kind and friendly and just seemed like they wanted to help and wanted to be there. they were meticulous. we would definitely come again. thank you to all staff especially Marianthi and Soraia on reception (sorry if names are not spelt correctly!). cons: slightly slow on the pool bar and quite expensive - a beer is 9/10euros."

A truly 5 star luxurious holiday from the moment we walked through the stunning entrance to leaving.
Pool areas are beautiful particularly the Sandy beach pool which if you had young children would be absolutely perfect. Grounds are immaculate and it’s lovely to be able to walk around the lake and admire the stunning hotel.
The rooms are spotless and very comfortable and the Molton Brown products in the bathrooms were a lovely surprise. The staff are absolutely fantastic nothing was too much trouble particularly around the pool .Can’t fault anything about this wonderful hotel and we will absolutely be returning next year .

- Wide variety of things to choose from. Fresh hot cold. It all was there and delicious. 
Room: 
- Nice setup.
- Comfy bed even though it was two twins pushed together.
- Toilet was nice and had a bidet. 
- Big tub.
Pools:
- Were nice enough.
Restaurant on the beach:
- Food and drinks that actually arrived to our table were delicious. Had one guy there that did help us with our order but only after it had gone quite wrong. 





Restrooms by lobby bar:
- Ran out of room in the negative text section was using toilets on way to breakfast at 8.30am and toilets weren't clean in two of the stalls. Only did this one day so can't be sure if one off or recurring but still disappointing. cons: Room:
- Flooring in room uncomfortable to walk on.
- Complimentary wine bottle wouldn't open and cork fell apart without us getting any wine out of it.
- Squeaky doors to wardrobe space - was introduced to the room  by a front desk attendant and was shown the mini bar and fridge behind one of the wardrobe doors and it emitted a painfully loud squeak that she even winced at but never bothered to try and fix it.
- There's no shower head in bath tub so you need to get out of the tub and move to the shower to rinse off.
Pools:
- Not deeper than 4 feet.
- Sandy beach pool is only sand to about 2 feet deep then changes to a rather rough pool bottom that I ended up wearing flip flops while in the pool because it hurt my feet that much from the pool bottoms (all three had this same issue)
- The hotel itself wasn't compliant with their own pool policy (no toys or floats) so couldn't enjoy any of the pools without floats and children's toys being thrown at you or bumping into you.
Service:
- English speaking staff was intermittent at best. Advice: bring your phone and google translate with you just to ask for some ice water in 36 degree heat and not have it show up.
- Prepare to ask multiple times for the same thing from different people because they tend to not deliver. This occurred at check-in breakfast and poolside but also at one of the hotel restaurants (the one on the beach).
Restaurant on the beach:
- Painfully expensive for what you get if you manage to get all of the food you ordered delivered to you.
- Again English speakers here was a bit of a miss didn't get our starter finally got our main 1.5 hours into the dinner asked where our starter was and they concluded the starter order was never entered in their system and asked us if we wanted it alongside our meal or after it. No sign of original staff member after this until we asked someone else to give us our bill so we could escape and go somewhere else entirely."

We all booked the same category and paid the same price for the rooms except for them as couples they shared a room while I had my own I was given a horrible room which was next to the kids area while my other friends were given different categories which had bigger space balcony and one of them even was a suite. I informed the hotel that we are paid the same price and I was expecting to get a similar category. However they told me they are out of rooms. This made my experience unpleasant. ￼ This is of course including ￼ a low level of cleaning where the housekeeping did not even remove the trash and give me plastic bags to put my own trash. Furthermore there were many moths in the room. The only reason I could find for such treatment was the discrimination based on the passport as I had as different passport than the other two couple. ￼

The buffet was ok but when i went to get some salad at breakfast and wr qas some of the first there that day i lifted the lettuce and  it was full of hundreds of little files which put me off having anyrhing as they obviously did not clean the food and it had been sat for sometime for that to happen. this hotel is deffinetly not 5*

Pool are was nice ( although overcrowded) 
Spa was nice. cons: The hotel needs serious work: the windows across the overal hotel were dirty some of the walls are scrapped it looks dated and for a 5 start hotel that is not acceptable. The room where I had a spa treatment smelled of mould and had a infliltration on the ceiling ( you can see the water bubbles). Also soeone opened the door while I was having my pedicure... I mean. In my bedroom ( 261) the woden doors looked like they neede a lick of varnish or good wood treatment. All looks like it needs seriopus refurbishement and there is a lack of attention to detail

Service at the bar and at the restuarants was awful and far frm a 5 star standard ( tue quality of food was ok though) .The staff is on a constant rush to rmeove plates from you and keep interrupting guest with the constant question: can I rmeove your plate. The general manager ( i am assuming) that runs the service in the bar and restaurants knows nothing about service and needs to be seriously considered. The staff constantly moans and argues between themlseves in front of guests. I have no words for the service levels.

I have asked for an iron and ironing board to the room and was waiting for more than one hour. 3 calls to receptions made it happen!!

All hotel restuarants close for lunch so guests are only left with pool bar. 

I have done half board and at dinner you had to queue to give your room number and be seated and you had to queue again to ask for you bill should you had any drinks. Only food was included. As you can imagine everyone has drinks so everyone has to get up and queue... Bringing the bill to the table NO. 

Its a nice building with a lot of potential but its not a 5 star. There are much better 5 star and actually 4 start hotels in the Algarve area. Nice pools sells itself on the look of it but its not worth it.

Go somewhere else."

El trato de todo el personal desde que llegas hasta que te vas es exquisito. Cuentan con un servicio de aparca coches lo cual es conveniente puesto que llegamos con un coche alquilado. 

La habitación es amplia y el baño se divide en dos partes: la parte del WC y la de bañera y ducha. En la habitación cuentas con nevería y cafetera con café de cortesía. La cama es muy cómoda de 2x2 y cada tarde/noche el hotel cuenta con servicio de turnover que se encarga de preparar la habitación para dormir y proporcionar dos botellas de agua grandes y unos chocolates de cortesía. Nos dejaron una tarta y una botella de cava por el cumpleaños de mi novio sin si quiera haber dicho nada nosotros. No obstante al estar nuestra habitación en el primer piso dando al jardín se llenó rápidamente de hormigas y tuvimos que tirarla. Hay que tener esto en cuenta puesto que todos los días nos hemos encontrado alguna hormiga en la habitación.
El desayuno es muy bueno aunque recomiendo ir temprano sobre todo en esta época puesto que sobre las 10h se suele llenar mucho más. Hay opciones sin gluten saludables y también un puesto de huevos bacon etc. El zumo de naranja es recién exprimido.  
La zona de la piscina es muy relajante. Las toallas se pueden coger allí mismo sin necesidad de dejar ninguna fianza (como había leído en otros comentarios). De hecho nos llevamos un par para pasar el día en la playa y no hubo ningún problema. Siempre hay disponibilidad de hamacas con espacio de sobra. Las piscinas cuentan con un bar en el que se puede pedir tanto comida como bebida que te pueden servir en las mismas tumbonas. Comimos allí un día y la verdad es que bastante bueno.
En el bar del lobby también ponen música en directo varios días y se puede comer tipo hamburguesa patatas fritas etc. Lo recomiendo mucho después de un día cansado y sirven coktail increíbles. cons: El café del desayuno es pésimo: servido de dos grandes cafeteras por los camareros al estilo americano. Teniendo buenas cafeteras en la habitación no se explica que en el desayuno se sirva este café insípido.

Me llama la atención que no haya un restaurante de cocina portuguesa en un hotel como este. El restaurante fusión griego-portugués está bien pero no da la talla en este aspecto. Si estás 5 noches las opciones para cenar se hacen repetitivas teniendo en cuenta que el restaurante Blend sólo abre dos días. Además el Blend aunque muy bueno nos pareció excesivo en cuanto a su precio. 

El SPA fue una decepción total y no está a la altura del hotel. Lleno de niños tirándose de cabeza y chillando sin que la recepcionista les llamase la atención. Los masajes fueron increíbles yo repetí con Barbara dos días gracias. No obstante es horrible salir relajado y encontrarte con niños gritando en la sauna piscina etc. 

El recibimiento fue muy bueno pero la salida no tan buena. El señor de recepción simplemente nos ha dado la factura sin mirarnos preguntarnos cómo había ido ni tener ningún tipo de interacción con nosotros. No es lo que esperas de un hotel así."

Optámos por jantar também e não achei um buffet para um hotel de luxo. 
De lamentar que em pleno inverno (e será assim noutras estações) só deixem as crianças a partir dos 4 anos usufruir da piscina interior só com marcação e só até às 14h. Viajamos com crianças é um hotel para crianças mas não lhes dão as devidas condições. 
Fiz a minha reserva quase com um mês de antecedência. Pedi dois quartos muito perto por sermos uma familia de 3 adultos e duas crianças. Acabámos por ficar com quartos entre os nossos quando mesmo à nossa frente estavam dois quartos juntinhos com um casal e um filho e no outro a avó.
O hotel é de excelência e quem o procura deseja encontrar isso mesmo."

O mesmo na praia na zona concessionada onde os hóspedes chegavam ao ponto de as levar e no fim irem embora sem as recolherem.

Acolhimento comida instalações localização atividades e spa maravilhoso. Apesar do restaurante Gustatio estar incluso na diária como opção de buffet o restaurante Topos é ímpar. Uma fusão de Portugal e Grécia! nos chamou a atenção vários colaboradores durante nossas férias: Rodrigo (mensageiro) Diogo e Raquel (recepção e concierge) Denyse (brasileira que trabalha no Gustatio e no bar do resort) Carolina (Topos) e a número 1 em simpatia… Bruna (spa). cons: Há algumas modalidades de upgrade que fiquei sabendo apenas durante a estadia.

A cama é muitíssimo confortável espaçosa lençois suaves proporcionando um óptimo descanso. A possibilidade de ficar indoors outdoors ou ""meio termo"" no Gustatio é excelente. As nossas toiletries eram da Molton Brown e ficamos impressionados com a sua qualidade muitas vezes esse tipo de produtos cheiram bem mas não são hidratantes neste caso o condicionador é bem suavizante uma coisa muito apreciada para cabelos que andam na piscina e praia e muitas vezes os hotéis não dão importância. A maioria dos funcionários foi super simpática. A Nadia responsável pelo espaço disponível a quartos de maior categoria é muito atenciosa e atenta ao detalhe excelente profissional.
BBQ night no Gustatio muito bom lulas grelhadas saborosíssimas. cons: Já tinhamos estado neste hotel antes e infelizmente desceu um pouco de qualidade. O grupo Domes decidiu pintar as fontes/repuxos do hotel mudou do normal azul para um cinzento esverdeado que fica muito muito feio! Além de pintar por cima dos ladrilhos (elemento muito Português) o que por si já é um mau trabalho a cor é absurda e nem se vê a água dos repuxos é como se as fontes não existissem a água nem brilha ao sol. Foi-nos comentado que aquela cor iria pintar todo o hotel no futuro o que é uma pena. O grupo Domes por ser grego parece querer implementar uma cultura e look gregos ao hotel (através das comidas e das cores escolhidas) o que me parece um tiro no pé se as pessoas vêm de férias para Portugal é para encontrar a experiência de Portugal e não da Grécia. Para isso vamos à Grécia. A fruta disponível principalmente no pequeno-almoço é pouca e não teve muita qualidade o que nos deixou surpreendidos pela negativa. É pena que o hotel tenha apostado tanto em toppings de panquecas e se esqueceu de frutas. O sítio onde são colocadas as miniaturas de pastelaria (croissants folhados etc) foi uma má escolha do hotel estes alimentos são muito apelativos para crianças (e todos nós) e o suporte destes alimentos é o mais baixo existente no buffet e está mesmo ao nível dos mais pequeninos acontece que eles passam o tempo a tocar nas miniaturas com as mãos ou deixam cair e voltam a por no sítio escusado será dizer o quanto isto é pouco higiénico. As almofadas que encontramos na cama à chegada literalmente cheiravam mal foram trocadas de imediato e foi-nos dito que era porque eram novas não voltou a acontecer mas achamos estranho não aparecer um responsável ou uma chamada para pedir desculpa de um sucedido tão estranho.
O Topos é inferior ao restaurante que estava sob a alçada do grupo Blue and Green não acho que valha o preço. Na realidade não vimos melhorias relativamente ao grupo que geria o hotel anteriormente."

I was amazed at how quiet the hotel was. I never heard any noise coming from any other room. I also found the perfect gift for a friend and the reception staff were fabulous at putting it all together for me. The hotel is centrally located just a stones throw away from the Castle and within walking distance to absolutely everything. cons: I had asked them to make a dinner reservation for me which unfortunately wasn't done but in the end it worked out fine. And I would have liked to get a nice massage but aalas I just didn't have time so I guess I'll have to go again and possibly for a longer period.

The location is perfect. The staff are very welcoming and the service is impeccable. Our room was spacious and the bed very comfortable with a large bathroom and plenty of storage. The lavish buffet breakfasts are exceptional with everything you could want and more the best we've experienced anywhere. Altogether a very special few days. cons: A few small things. 
We're puzzled by the uncharacteristic meanness of providing only four teas and coffees in the room and then charging for extras. Strange when everything else is so generous.
A small personal gripe (common to many hotels) - the room was dimly lit and we found it difficult to read at night. Bedside reading lights would be welcome.
Also a second comfortable chair in the room would be welcome - there's plenty of space."

There were only a few people staying as it was off season. For some STRANGE reason they put us in a room at the very end of the facility.  At 2 am we were woken up by LOUD yelling and partying and slamming of doors and windows right NEXT to our room!! Finally I has to call front desk at 3 am and ask why they would put people obviously at the hotel party RIGHT NEXT  to our room knowing that their were at LEAST 75 rooms available!!! Needless to say we did not get much sleep but they did have the party next door move to a different room!!  So...what I did not like is that the front staff did not put much thought into where they were having guests stay for the night!!! Why on EARTH would they put them right next to our room!!! that is the million dollar question and frankly quite interesting!!

Dinner not such good value and quality as some of the restaurants in Tavira! Further as with many classic hotels in particular  the ‘lighting’ in the bedroom was frankly poor!

One of the calmest and most easy going hotel experiences we have ever had. Even though fully booked there was so much space and calmness to find in the building. Fantastic location to walk to all main attractions of Tavira. The pool area was an oasis in the middle of the town. Fantastic breakfast with fresh regional products and specialties. Very good and friendly service from the staff and the most amazing setting to eat inside the courtyard of the old monastery. cons: There is nothing to complain about our stay the smallest inconvenience was taken care of by the friendly and caring staff. 
If you're not a morning person it is best to take breakfast indoors the courtyard chairs can make an awful noise. But the experience of dining there makes up for it!"

Staff are super friendly welcoming and helpful hotel itself is beautiful with a lovely pool and grounds. Breakfast was plentiful great choices attention by Chef at all times. cons: The air conditioning wasnt very effective it was particularly hot the week we stayed (high 30's) so maybe this didnt help. Other guests asked to be moved as had same issue. We found the tea facility in our room slightly odd there were 3 teabags no coffee no milk and you had to pay 3 euros per teabag if you wanted any more. You could request a Nespresso machine but were charged 3 euros per pod! For a 4 star hotel found this to be disappointing. These were our only issues everything else was wonderful.

We loved the serenity of the courtyard on arrival where we sat and enjoyed a drink. The variety of breakfast options the quietness of the pool area and of course the courtesy and attentiveness of staff. The large open spaces and decor around the hotel gave it such a regal feeling. 
We spent 9 nights here for my 60th birthday and we couldn't have picked a better stay for this occasion. It was made so much more special when I was greeted with cake and champagne left in our room. 
I booked a facial and massage which was worth every penny. 
We also ate a superb meal at the hotel restaurant one evening.
We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
Thank you for making our stay so special. cons: There wasn't much not to like. Perhaps at least another cabana at the pool."

I also think having some more information about the area walks sights etc. would be good (the tourist info in town was shut the first few days we were there). Obviously you can find stuff online but sometimes it helps to have real life copies! But really minor niggles as I say this was lovely and we’d definitely return.

The hotel itself was a lovely building with old world charm and a nice relaxing pool area. It really was a haven. The staff were for the most part helpful helping with things like tuk tuk booking. The room was elegant and comfortable. cons: The hotel could have been a bit better with helping with restaurant bookings. I was just told to try my luck as apparently it is hard to get a booking this time of year though I would have thought a hotel of this reputation would have had links to good restaurants where it would have priority to book. The breakfast was decent though there could have been more savoury vegetarian options. There was also an odd incident where they decided to change my mattress during the middle of my stay for no clear reason.

The breakfast was exceptionally good with a different choice each day of pastries and other goodies.  The staff were all welcoming and attentive without ever becoming intrusive - it always felt like we were being left to enjoy ourselves in our own temporary home.  The room was fine although the bed was firmer than we are used to and it had a balcony overlooking the pool.  The pool is set in a lovely relaxing environment in the sun with a few trees to provide shade and is surrounded by sun-loungers and over-head parasols and access to tables and chairs at which to enjoy snacks and drinks from the adjacent bar area.  It was cleaned each morning and set at a perfect temperature for a refreshing swim in the sunshine. 

All of the staff through out the hotel were a delight - helpful cheerful and courteous.

The central location gave us access to local restaurants and tennis courts in Tavira but also the local villages of Santa Luzia Cacela Velha and Moncarapacho for our favourite beaches and restaurants. cons: Once or twice the scrambled egg was a little over-cooked a bit firm and dry.  The toaster can be a bit of a bottle-neck and could perhaps be upgraded to provide multiple slots to allow more than one simultaneous user.

The beds felt a little tired and firmer than we are used to - perhaps thought needs to be given to upgrading these.

Perhaps there could be more parasols round the pool to provide all sun-loungers with access to shade.

Once or twice the car park was overfull - it is difficult for most people to see that many of the spaces covered by the wisteria are actually available for two cars not just one.

A small point this: I appreciate that it is courteous and respectful for the reception to stand up and greet new arrivals but from time to time it felt quite regimented that all of the reception staff would stand (to attention) in unison on our entry to the hotel. I am sure it is good practice but I felt a bit sorry for them."

We had booked a room with a terrace - it was very comfortable.  The staff were very helpful and nice.  They helped us also book our sightseeing. cons: They need to develop more options for vegetarians.  We reached Tavira a bit late in the evening after a long drive and didn’t want to go out for dinner.  But there were very few options for vegetarian food at the restaurant.  This is a premium property and so they should make sure they have a reasonable selection for everyone staying.

Although this hotel came up in the ‘spa’ filter on Booking.com there was only a massage room.

The staff were extremely friendly and nothing was too much effort. We had booked this hotel for my wife's birthday and in the late afternoon room service knocked on our bedroom door. I opened it to see a waitress carrying a tray laden with chocolate cake and champagne. I said: ""You must have the wrong room; I have not ordered anything."" She said ""It's your wife's birthday; this is on the house."" What a surprise! And how very thoughtful. (The birthday must have been identified when our passport details were taken during check-in.)

Breakfast was very good; wi-fi was sufficient for video streaming; parking was easy as the hotel has its own private facilities. 

Highly recommended. cons: "

There was a large hole in the bedspread. The light fitting on the balcony floor was broken and the jagged metal sticking out was dangerous and a trip hazard. Only 4 tea bags and one bottle of water provided for the whole stay no replenishments allowed. 
We were asked after our first night to fill in a survey about our stay. We were honest and wrote as above stating we would be available the next morning to discuss if needed. On returning from dinner at 11pm that evening the reception staff challenged us about our comments. He was extremely defensive and annoyed about what we had said and made us feel very uncomfortable. This really spoilt our evening."

The room was great clean comfortable bed and very nice. The bathroom was nice and clean but the water pressure was not good. The wifi was problematic it worked in certain areas and not in others even though the signal was good throughout the property this was 'fixed' in the next business day after a complaint was made to reception. cons: The restaurant! Usually the Pousadas chain hotels have great dining experiences but this one was not the case The wine list was poor without ANY dry white wines the waiter was also not very knowledgable about the few wines they did cary. The staff at the checkin although nice were highly inefficient as we waited for quite a while for then to find out printed files. Lastly the water pressure for the showers was quite poor.

The hotel itself and its courtyard are beautiful and the breakfasts wonderful. The young staff were all really friendly especially the waiter & bartender Andreia who with her genuinely lovely smile made you feel at home & looked after. cons: Extremely expensive hotel for what you get. There should be nicer sun beds and more than just one lounge bed! Wooden terrace around the  pool needs renovating as it had several loose boards and rubbish stuck underneath. The bar had a very limited selection with no dry espumante nor any nice dry wine by the glas and just one of each spirits. The 3 hotel rooms (we had to move rooms twice due to a leak and then a broken toilet which broke was fixed then broke again in the evening) were quite sad feeling with shower inside a cheap PVC bath and scratched wood flooring. One only gets one free water bottle. For a hotel of this category you would expect free still water as the tap water tastes strongly of chlorine.

Architecturally the construction is well thought out providing guests with a sense of privacy and space while respecting the natural surroundings. The rooms and bathrooms are of a high standard although the mattresses could be improved. The bar and lobby are very cosy and the cocktails do not disappoint. Breakfast is in keeping with the standard of the hotel with good produce and well-prepared food (although the service could be quicker and more attentive). I would definitely recommend this hotel for people who are not scared to drive through dirt and gravel roads oddly it seems to bother many people i thought it was quite refreshing. Staff is extremely attentive and always keen to help and facilitate. cons: The quality of the mattress could be better and the service in the restaurant could be a bit more efficient. On both days during my stay i had to go through 3 salt and pepper shakers to get some salt or pepper. Once seated guests should be asked about bread and coffee seeing these need to be brought to you from the kitchen. these are minor points and I am only really raising them so provide feedback as i do think this hotel has the potential to impress and delight most guests

Special thanks to Bruno Selina and Bellboy who are truly amazing!"

A big thank you to Melanie (front desk)  and Sasha (bartender) for their impeccable service. The room is clean and spacious we had a nice view from our little terrace. Esteva Spa is definitely a must-do. Room service also very thoughtful and quick. It can get a little cold but they have heating system in the rooms that keeps it a very nice temperature. Very comfy beds and pillows. We wouldn't change anything about the rooms. cons: Unfortunately for us there had been a big group before our check in perhaps wedding guests. This resulted in less attention of detail and care going into the rest of the hotel guests such as ton of dirty towels around pool area not being cleaned up same in the spa area lunch area not prepared on time so we had to wait but nothing was too major we still enjoyed our time there. The next day was better as the big groups had left. After that everything seemed calmer and better organized.

Nevertheless we had an amazing week at the hotel and the road didn’t affect at all our week plans.

The rooms hotel grounds and facilities are excellent. The design of the whole hotel is beautiful and it has so many fantastic touches in all the public areas. It’s also very peaceful and set in gorgeous and extensive grounds. cons: The staff are lovely and really keen to provide great service but I think there must be a training or management issue as we frequently found the service to be slow and a bit disorganised especially at our last dinner when it was quite poor. The food was very nice when it arrived. Service at breakfast was a lot slicker. I would also say that there were some really good staff particularly in the bar where Sasha is a delight.
Our other comment would be the noise from the garden maintenance team during our stay. As I said the grounds are beautiful and so will need maintaining but the beautiful peace and tranquility that is a feature of the hotel was frequently interrupted by petrol-powered strimmers and the sound of other power tools during the day."

First and foremost it was a surprise stay for me and my wife as we were coming here straight after our wedding. I mentioned it twice to the hotel through booking com to see if it is possible to make any arrangements for a room / decoration or anything else. I also mentioned that we do not drink alcohol. Upon arrival none of the staff acknowledged the special occasion the room had a welcome bottle of Prosecco… this is where we a small luxury hotel I expect it to be able to give more attention to those details 

2) you must book your restaurant for dinner one night I called at 7pm and the only slot they had for 9:15 despite it being a small property with a pretty big restaurant (I assume staffing is a limitation). Would not be an issue in most places but here the closest restaurants are 15min away on a road full of potholes

3) our bath had dirty water however luckily the maintenance guy managed to resolve it relatively quickly

So overall a nice hotel but missing the mark on hospitality"

We loved the rural location and the local walking/ hiking trails. We were well fuelled by a generous & expansive breakfast offering great lunch choices & dinners. 

After exercising we thoroughly enjoyed the pool and spa areas. The lady front of house in the spa was an absolute delight. Everyone should aspire to deliver her level of personal service (remembering names time preferences etc.). She made our trip! 

Overall a wonderful stay we’d definitely visit again. cons: Two minor points:
1. They need to offer fries with lunch/ dinner. Vegetable crisps from a packet are no good (even if made by the chef).
2. Better filling of pot holes at least at the hotel entrance.


Bigger complaint- sound proofing. We were in a ground floor suite and we could hear the people above us. This needs to be sorted."

One of the highlights of my stay was the dinner. It was an absolute delight for the senses with each dish meticulously prepared and bursting with flavor. The culinary experience was simply unforgettable.

Overall it was a dream vacation and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and relaxing escape. cons: However the journey to the hotel was quite adventurous. Improved signage along the way would be greatly appreciated to make the arrival smoother. This is a detail and will be forgotten upon arrival."

Extensive breakfast with multitude of nice options. cons: We stayed on the 1st floor room of the cubicle we were in and could hear neighbours beneath us speak meaning the isolation is not great but nothing really disturbing. 

We would advice to have some kind of blinding for the window in the bathroom that is not privacy proof when walking out of the shower."

Great location middle in the nature nice hiking roots to the ocean. The arrival is not dramatic at all if you take the right root. Spacious and good equipped gym big parking lots. 

Great restaurants in the are of 15-20m drive. 

Spa area is also pretty and is heaven 
as long as you are alone there. 

Great cappuccino at breakfast.

Very good wifi everywhere. 

Very warm reception with champagne. cons: On the first day the spa was closed - because we were the only guest in the entire hotel. So I am pretty sure they could not be bothered to keep it open for 2 people only. Very disappointing when you only have 3 days. 

Also no possibility to borrow a bike for couple of hours. Being alone in the entire hotel we still had an option to either rent it for a half a day or a full day only. I understand this policy in summer but in February when you are alone there hmmm.

Spa is small and has 4 beds only but during my last day 9 people were in there so was chaotic. Screaming kid in the spa - adult only would be appropriate. Steam room was closed the shoe time. 

Breakfast is dominated by gluten."

We love the severe architecture and design and how it fits with the beautiful natural surroundings. All the staff is excellent and hospitable. We adored our morning classes and the spectacular walks to the beach before breakfast. 
This is one of the best breakfasts we ever had by the way. The food is excellent throughout. And the pool is big enough to accommodate everyone. cons: -"

The rooms were completed with high quality finishes and very clean. The pool area was fantastic with bar service to your sun loungers. The bar at the hotel was great and they could make any drink you wanted. The breakfast was also really good. cons: The location meant you either had to eat in the on-site restaurant or drive but there were limited options nearby. The menu in the restaurant was limited and often they didn’t have everything in stock - but the food was amazing. The food was also on the expensive side compared to the rest of Portugal (e.g. €6 pp for bread). The lunch service by the pool was very slow and we often had to ask for things multiple times.

It is located in a beautiful and peaceful location within a natural park. It is clear that the architects and designers wanted to respect the place starting from the shapes and colors of the structure on the outside and in the interior design. All the staff is extremely kind and professional assisting the customer from arrival to departure and throughout every day spent in the hotel. The breakfast is exceptional with a huge choice of products and a lot of variety from day to day. The Azeitona restaurant inside is perfect for gourmet dining the chef is excellent. The swimming pool is very large and allows for a nice afternoon rest if you don't want to go to the beach. Arrifana beach is few minutes away and it is very beautiful with constant ocean winds: a surfers' paradise. We stayed in a very comfortable and spacious sea view suite with attention to all the details. cons: Given the level of the hotel it could be useful to improve the spaces and the experience in the spa.

Loved the design of hotel rooms and restaurant. It’s different from other hotels so it was very different stay for us. Room and bathroom is very spacy and quiet. Restaurant’s meals are GREAT absolutely worth the price. At the dinner I ate the best cauliflower in my life desserts and coctails were great too. Breakfast has lot of choices also very good. cons: Hotel’s location is not the best it’s in the middle of nothing. There are two roads Google maps took us on the worse one which is sandy road full of stones. Our rental car was big car with smaller car we wouldn’t be able to go on that way. By the way Google maps shows location of the hotel wrong-it shows the beach not the hotel. Hotel’s stuff told us to use the other road which was better but still at night it’s not the best way to go. If you want also to see other places in Algarve as Faro Albufeira etc. this hotel won’t be the best location to stay. Pool was little bit dirty. Hotel seems to be very nature friendly that’s why red colour by the pool (sunbeds umbrellas…) doesn’t match so well with the nature in my opinion that’s what I would change in the future:)

The staff couldn’t do more to help you and were so good with my toddler. The breakfast and food in general was 5* - so tasty a real treat to experience. 
The hotel building itself was so stylish and a joy to stay at. cons: Only little piece of feedback would be that the pool needs a little cleaning on the bottom and sides as was quite slippy."

The decor is splendid every detail considered. 
The room was spacious the bedding quite comfortable and great pillows. 
The food was great but expensive and limited offer. 

I enjoyed this place very much I would suggest to up the service level. Get guests' names in advance share hotel services (spa activities etc) beforehand get to know what would suit the guests who they are allergies or concerns. cons: The access to the hotel is terrible it is something that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.
The food was very much on the high price (bread+hummus+carrots 8euros per person). 
The staff kept going in and out of the rooms for cleaning and only at nighttime you would have quietness around the buildings not that pleasant.
The room was not entirely soundproofed and we could hear the other guests above us. Also something somehow disturbing the bathroom has a window that at the ground level exposes whoever is in this room. Noticed it the first day and then stepped out to check if indeed one could see inside and yes one does. I would advise to consider blurring this window somehow."

Everything about it is great. First off the hotel looks really good. Both the interior decoration and the exterior architecture. The weather was quite bad (very windy) but still we had an amazing time. We ate at the restaurant twice and we really enjoyed it. The bar was great too the barman was super nice. There was plenty of space and sunchairs by the pool. cons: I think there are two significant problems with the hotel. First is the access road which is in really poor shape. Unless you have a jeep your car will suffer.
The second issue and that is a bigger one is that the hotel has a lot of stairs. If you have a baby in a stroller like we did your back will suffer since you have to carry it everywhere including two flights of stairs to the room."

did the enquiry before booking about the swimming pool facilities for the kids where we were informed that “kids can use indoor pool”; however on arrival there was unpleasant surprise - kids are allowed to the indoor pool only 10am-12pm (2 hours only) and the rest of the day you are left without the possibility to use that indoor pool; 

if we were informed about it before booking that wouldn’t be a problem; but we asked specifically for the kids possibility to use the pool (as the outdoor pool is freezing)

very disappointing as the rest of the hotel was fantastic"

Breakfast not only tasted good but also looked pretty.

Our compliments to the architect and the interior designers.Superb. cons: Staff was amazing but in the restaurant too slow.
it was hard to get a bottle of wine. The first evening we waited 25 minutes and the second evening asked in the kindest possible way the lady showing us to our table to not forget us once we sat down and come and for someone to take our drinks order. It made no difference. I think their ‘system’ (with some allowed to take orders and some not) does not work. It’s too complicated. When we complained (which is unusual and we did so politely) the reaction we got was unpleasant. That said the staff and waiters were on general very pleasant and friendly so this was an ‘outlier’ experience! It did not take away from our overall experience and had it not been for this we would have scored a 10 out of 10!"

Raod to it is bumpy but is like all the other roads off the main path in that area of portugal so expected and should not be changed. cons: despite it being billed as an eco resort there was zero information available in the rooms as to what made it an eco resort. We did get some info from the cocktail bar man because he had the time to talk to us. Would be good if more information about the nature reserve and what the hotel is doing to manage its impact is available in short in the room somewhere to read. Even a little description of the birds we might hear and the flowers we are seeing. a missed opportunity for the guests that are really into nature. Lunch food by the hotel was disappointing given the price of it. Two salads and each had 1.5 tomato halves meaning only 3 tomatoes used in two salads. not good for the price of it.

There is a really excellent breakfast with a large menu of cooked options a fab small spa area which has max 6 people at one time so very relaxing (you need to book). Elemis products in room and spa and turn down service in the room in the evening. It was my birthday and they bought an iced bottle of cava on arrival and 2 glasses of champagne with a delicious chocolate cake on the day. We felt pampered and spoilt and didn't want to leave. A quiet and relaxing break and we will definitely return. cons: The access road is appalling an unmaintained dirt track very rough and bumpy. We tried approaching from the north (don't do it unless you have a sturdy jeep!) and really thought we wouldn't make it -  a steep dirt road very rough and full of potholes. The access from the south is better but still completely unsigned and in a dreadful condition in places. We arrived in a very negative frame of mind due to this.
The restaurant Azeitona does excellent breakfasts but we had a bad experience at dinner it was very expensive (12 euros for bread butter and a small saucer of olive oil!) and also expensive main courses considering they came with nothing else on the plate except a smear of sauce. All garnishes and side dishes have to be ordered separately but there were very limited choices and so nothing was matched to the individual dishes. There were also some issues with cookery of our mains. We were very disappointed but we raised our concerns with the waiting staff who tried hard to make amends and gave us a generous discount on the bill but we chose to eat out after the first night."

Beautiful surroundings peaceful and calm. The perfect place to reset and unwind. Wonderful amenities access to walks and lots of activities to pick from if you traveling with kids. We did the donkey sanctuary and  pottery workshop.  The property is beautiful. Even though it is very modern the materials they have selected are very organic and blend in with its natural surroundings. When the vegetation matures it is going to look even more stunning.  Even though the hotel is tucked away  it is easy to access  Aljezur and the nearby beaches with a car. 

Our room was spacious comfortable and we appreciated the extra little touches like the welcome champagne. We also loved the deck chairs outside. 

The spa facilities were small but good.  First time we have done the spa as a family and my son loved it 😃

Breakfasts were exceptional and we loved how flexible the staff were at accommodating our requests. Staff overall were super friendly and helpful. 

We loved our stay here. Just what  our family needed. Thank you. cons: We loved our experience. I think the spa pool is too small relative to the size of the hotel. But this is managed well through a booking system. And i think the restaurant is overpriced."

Another thing it is probably much more advisable to travel there by summer time. We spent 3 nights and I can surely praise the staff A LOT. They did a lot of care especially for our kid whom they got involved into helping around the hotel daily rhythm and that was better than any kids club. Service is on the very high level we truly enjoyed at the restaurant and in the bar. The food was great - tasty creative modern and enough to choose from within the days we stayed. cons: This is personal but there were plenty of what we disliked.
- the road that leads to this place (last 3km) is HORRIBLE. We were with SUV during the dry weather and still bad. 
- the overall architecture looks strange and ugly. The rooms have good facilities and nice bathroom yet the entry is messy due to always not being clean (gravy road that leads to the rooms) and as you open the door you are bumping into the bed.
- Spa was useless. Few saunas (small) tiny small inner pool - kind of heated but COLD very cramped and small area overall (why? there is so much space around..)
- The outdoor pool is beautiful but not heated at all. Unsure what is the point of that beyond summer months?
- the breakfast selection was so-so. Limited choice on buffet and a la carte doesn't compensate for that."

Beautiful scenery and the facilities were amazing. From the moment we walked into the hotel to when we checked out we felt completely relaxed by and emersed in the experience of the hotel. It has so many nice little touches throughout our stay and it’s really a beautiful hotel.

Although modern it does blend into the beautiful surroundings. We had a great walk from hotel to Praia do Canal then Arrifana for lunch and back to hotel. It was good to just leave car in the car park for two days. The staff was exceptionally pleasant helpful and professional. We spent a very relaxing time in the spa and very much enjoyed our massages. We ate well in the restaurant the chocolate dessert well worth the calories. cons: Yes the restaurant is a bit pricey - but no more than you would expect in a hotel like this. We enjoyed the food but can see that for more than a short stay you might want more choice. There is a more casual restaurant by the pool for lunch... but didn´t try it.

Staff was super welcoming and kind.

The sunsets on the patio are one of a kind.

Architecture is done in a very meticulous and elevated style. The west-facing patios geometrical lines of the buildings. Timeless interiors and gorgeous lobby.

Keep in mind that if you are staying long you might get bored with the room service menu. We found it was a great idea going out by car to the nearest city to lunch or dine there & grab some groceries from the market on some days. cons: Nothing. Wish to be back one day ❤️"

It is a small hotel so even in peak season (August) it was not crowded.  The rooms are very spacious.  The bathrooms are huge and beautiful.  Loved the bath products.  We loved our welcome wine and snack.  It was a nice touch after a long drive.  Food in the restaurant was good however dinner prices were high and you couldn't eat there every day otherwise it would get repetitive. Breakfast - light buffet + eggs from menu - was very good.  I would suggest adding pancake or waffles for the children.  Pool is beautiful but it was quite cold even though the weather was hot.  The area is set back from the beach but it can get windy and it was cooler than Lagos and other beach areas.  You need a car to get there and then explore the beaches and restaurants in the area.  We loved this hotel off the beaten track! cons: Road to hotel.

From the moment you arrive the staff are accommodating and nice and greet you with warmth. The views from the pool were incredible and the food at the restaurant and pool bar were delicious —although more casual options and a larger pool/lunch menu would be great. The room was comfortable and felt luxurious. If desired they offered a turn down service nightly that was so sweet. 

The staff was cheerful and eager to give recommendations—the restaurant server Jessica suggested a sunset and dinner in town that ended up a highlight of the trip! 

The spa needs some work. Professional spa attendants and treatment specialists are definitely needed.

- The access to the hotel is terrible. If you are taking a rental car opt for a AWD 4x4 robust vehicle. There is no actual paved road getting you up there. It’s more of a mixed earth rocky path with some pavement appointments.

I have nothing but praise for this property. It will definitely become one of Portugal's most sought after resorts once it's more well-known. I hope to return someday! cons: The property doesn't have any control over this but yes the road is a challenge. Any car should be able to make the journey but it is a bit stressful (especially when renting a car). However the seclusion is also part of the appeal.

The property should consider making certain spaces adult-only specifically the spa."

I think ties scarfs medium high-heels reception balconies show too much formality that somehow brings up some barriers between staff/customer interactions…. heads up to the staff but in particular to Joana that was the entry and departure face…she was just great/cool! I must say it was a big surprise to see a relaxed staff (didn’t look stressed in an unhealthy way) and with few formalities! keep it that way… Keep on guys! cons: perhaps try to have the staff more informed on the plates recipes !

The members of the staff were amazing very friendly and helpful and interacting with them was genuine and not a typical rigid hotel experience. We really enjoyed the views over the ocean and the park the comfort of the room and the terrace. We also loved the separate design of the hotel into smaller units. Our room was always spotless and fresh. The breakfast was delicious and we really loved the bar sitting with a drink there was very relaxing. We also loved the picnic baskets that we requested there are some amazing viewpoints to visit and enjoy a picnic during sunset. cons: As this is a relatively new place we understood that it has some minor faults so these are only our own remarks. The bar next to the pool could be a great spot for lunch but it has a very limited menu and feels a little boring after a while. Also the pool is not heated at all which can be very unpleasant when strong winds blow outside. The 'heated' indoor pool was cold too the water jets were not working and the outdoor pool of the spa was even colder. I think guests would use a lot more these places as they would be very relaxing if they were more tempered. Also the spa needs some maintenance the steam room was not working nor was the shower next to it so the only way to cool down after the sauna was the bucket 'shower'. Altogether this is gonna be an amazing place and the staff does everything to make you fell great.

First floor outlook offered beautiful views towards the Atlantic coastline. cons: Dining options including room service were extremely limited for a hotel of this standard especially given the prices. 
In addition the dining experience ( in particular dinner) was noisy and lacked atmosphere partly as a result of targeting young families. This doesn’t make sense as the hotel is a Spa hotel and doesn’t seem to offer facilities suitable for children.  
Finding the hotel  as mentioned on previous reviews was indeed a challenge with absolutely no signage which would have really helped."

Kids crying running screaming in the middle of the dining facilities. A family room or family times would be a good addition as you might find yourself in the middle of a quite nice charming and not cheap dinner with kids making too much noise.

The room was very comfortable but the bathroom has a very transparent glass facing the outdoor hiking path which makes it feel a little bit uncomfortable. And the restaurant menu while very good with some things had many very 'basic' dishes for an upscale restaurant (eg sandwiches and salmon salad).

Did not expect it when we first booked it and especially did not think it to be this pretty after we had already driven 10mins of dirt road into what seemed to be the absolut middle of nowhere. But then you are there. And its much prettier and more stunning then on their recent photos. Also: They have a very young and eager staff and just finished their soft opening and are very open for feedback and to make your stay as pleasant of possible. 
I really rarely had that many open and honest interactions with the staff at such a resort in my life. 
Very refreshing makes you feel even more comfortable if the views and lush nature around it arent already enough to please your soul. cons: As I said: They just finished their soft opening phase and still have a couple of things to figure out 
but since they are open for constructive feedback anything that is not to your liking will be fixed - and you´ll get a little extra on top. P.e.: we had a couple of minor points of critic and were immediately upgraded to one of their suites with a private roof and little pool which completely spoiled us but will get you a little idea about how commited they are. BTW - Thanks to Kristina & the crew from reception - that was a real nice treat for us!"

We had a lovely meal at the on-site restaurant which had a good selection of vegetarian dishes. And they even surprised my husband with a piece of cake for his birthday which we both appreciated and thought was very kind. Watching the gorgeous sunset from our balcony and using the fantastic spa facilities were also highlights of our stay. We can't wait to come back! cons: Nothing...everything was perfect!

The newly built hotel has only been formally open since the 1st January this year so the staff welcomed our feedback on any issues we came across. lovely sea view from our first floor room. cons: A bit tricky to find as it is located on an unnamed road but with the provided directions from the hotel we found it easily enough.

The check in process was extremely long winded the check out was not much better. On arrival we were told the dining room was full and we could not dine until 9:15 pm they suggested we go elsewhere to eat ! We explained that if we could not eat at a sensible time they should refund our payment and we would go and stay elsewhere they then accomodated our request of 7:45 pm when in the dining room it was far from being full or busy ! The food was good but not exceptional and orders were consistently presented incorrectly. All in all very disapointing especially in view of the price paid food drink and accomodation just under 600 euros per night !

The environment is calm and the pool area is nice and quiet. Rooms are spacious. cons: The inside pool wasn't warm. The staff told us they were trying to fix it but some friends were there 2 months before and they reported the same. Not acceptable in a place where there is not much to do. In addition when we asked for bikes they said they only had 3... and the staff told us they have more but they were for maintenance as it was low season. Very poor!"

• They ordered us flowers 💐 when we asked. 
• Surrounding nature is beautiful and perfect if you want away from civilization.  
• Sauna high quality
• Lovely breakfasts 
• Great fireplace in the bar 🍸 👏 
• Really nice little boutique clothes shop. 
• The Nepalese house keeping team are ace. 
• Front of house staff are always ready to help. cons: • Bed was two singles put together and was OK but not 5* comfortable.  
• Award winning Spa open only 10am-7pm which meant there was little time for us to enjoy it as we were out most days. We would have appreciated an 8or9am opening. 
• Roads surrounding hotel very pot holey. 
• 11am-1pm no possiblity to get food or drink as resto closed and no place around also their second restaurant closed for low season.  Not mentioned on website.  
• Lack of vegetarian options on restaurant menu only 1! 
• Having desk at the entrance of the bathroom in the room didn't feel good for working the room design could be better.  
• 15euro for room service was prohibitive.  Drinks should be brought to room free of charge. 
• Ocean view does not mean Ocean view you can not see ocean from room you have to walk uphill 30m to see a distant ocean. 
• The Laundry is ridiculously expensive.   We paid 60e for washing 9 pieces underwear 1 socks and 1 top."

The bathroom was designed nicely and the balcony sunsets were lovely. Not much to rave about. I would not go back. cons: Breakfast was too formal took forever all guests were annoyed it took 30mins just to get a coffee the wait staff wasn't very excited to help and it took forever for them to come to take just your coffee order. The regular americano coffee flavor was terrible. Extremely hard to get to the beaches or anywhere unless you had a great car and no one let us know any information about where to go or what to do. The staff was not the nicest. Seemed like we were bothering them. They took something from our room that was ours (and returned it) but at the same time this should not have happened.

The architecture is unique and blends with the surrounding 
Comfy room and bed good view of the sunsets
Good breakfast cons: It is still a bit disorganized especially around meal times
You always have to wait for your tables the restaurants do not have enough seats to accomodate everyone 
Staff forgets your orders or part of it
Overall the hotel is not aligned with a 5 stars hotel expectations"
Praia do Canal Nature Retreat- Small Luxury Hotels of the World,en-gb,2023-07-05,2023-07-06,couple,leisure,us,2.40000009536743,1,2023-07-19 20:51:00,"pros: Beautiful area great sommelier in restaurant good breakfast and very kind bell person. cons: There was an issue with our reservation. For more than three weeks we tried to contact the property by email and phone. Bookings also tried with zero success. Each time we were able to communicate by phone either the reservationist (Magdama - not sure about spelling but that was the only reservationist we knew of) was in a meeting or not there. They said they would leave a message and she’d call back.  Never heard from her. 

So we decided it would be best to communicate in person. When we arrived my travel partner tried to talk to the front desk and they said she needed to talk to the reservationist the following day. The next morning she went to talk to the reservationist and again “she was in a meeting”.  She asked for the manager but they were also in a meeting. She said she would wait because we needed to talk to someone before we left.  The manager came prepared with all her emails she had sent and apologized for the issue. He said “you have my word” that he would communicate with bookings and would send an email to her with an update by the end of the day.  Now two weeks later still no email and bookings said they did not hear from them. We realize now that the manager was likely just trying to get us to leave. Very very disappointing. 

Another issue was that we arrived slightly before check in which was not a the problem.  We relaxed by the pool. However the front desk said they would come and get us when the room was ready.  An hour after official check in we went to pool bar to ask if they could call to find out about our room. The reception said they forgot about us.  It was very strange.

Lastly there is poor communication between reception and the spa.  My advice is to pre-book your treatment before arriving. The spa was wonderful.

Overall we stayed at many nice hotels in Portugal and this one was just not worth the hassle. Beware of “in a meeting” response. Not sure if it is actually true."

The sound isolation is not good at all. Furthermore you can only approach the hotel through a dirt road so be prepared for some adventure. Finally we had a very late flight and wanted to check out later which was not possible the receptionist didn’t even mind to check the availability.
Praia do Canal Nature Retreat- Small Luxury Hotels of the World,en-gb,2023-05-12,2023-05-13,couple,leisure,by,2.79999995231628,1,2023-05-21 12:56:31,"pros: The resort has potential friendly staff and it's fresh (less than year and a half) but they have to improve many things. For now quite far away from ""world-class service"" but appreciate the attention from the general manager. He's very polite with the right mindset. 
If you want a high-quality resort in the south of Portugal I do recommend checking out some other options: 
- Herdade da Malhadinha Nova - Relais & Châteaux (stylish winery & resort);
- Octant Vila Monte (more like a very nice & cozy countryside resort); cons: - The road is awful. No the one is awful the second one is even worse. No way for sport or expensive cars. The management is working on it but not it's how it's;
+- There was some delay during the check-in. As far as I understand there was some error between booking.com and their software so the manager didn't see our reservation despite it being 100% prepaid. Luckily there were plenty of vacant rooms but during the high season it could be a problem. The property provided a complimentary bottle of wine as apologies for the inconvenience; 
- There is no transfer to the area/city nearby taxi services (uber bolt mytaxi) also don't work. So the only way to get in/out is to use your own car (keep in mind the road) or book some transfer very in advance; 
- There is only one restaurant and you have to make a reservation in advance. Nobody told us about that during the long check-in. If you come without reservation or earlier the staff isn't allowed to serve you a table because ""they have limited capacity to provide the highest service"" even if the restaurant occupancy rate is less than 40%. It took around 20 minutes to negotiate with the administrator to find a compromised option - wait half an hour with drinks and then get the menu half hour earlier for our reservation. But the restaurant staff and especially the sommelier are extremely nice and friendly no complaints. The food was ok nothing special;
- Last but not least the fire alarm was turned on at night around 2 or 3 am for a few minutes then turned off. So it was quite stressful and NOBODY say anything even during breakfast or the checkout process. Even a word. I can't understand the approach since the night sleep was ruined."

Interesting design of the hotel with a very cosy bar nice and smiling hosts cons: This place is NOT environment friendly.

Stylish rooms good and Tasty food!

Architecture is stunning and fits perfectly into the landscape. Nice pool area also very little little spa indoor area. cons: The road to the hotel is very pumpy - you have to be careful to not damage your car. Not suitable for sportscars like Porsche.

Stuff at the restaurants should be better trained."

- Nice walks available from the hotel -  we certainly recommend the walk to Praia de Vale Figueiras.
- Staff were very friendly with an incredibly hard-working front of house in the restaurant. 
- Stunning swimming pool! cons: We appreciate this is currently a soft opening - although we were not informed of this ahead of time. 

There are a few issues to be ironed out largely related to service in the restaurant: 

- We waited 20 minutes for water/menus in the restaurant. When water did arrive they served my partner before becoming distracted and leaving. 
- Bottles of water are not left on the table for guests. We received a mixture of still and sparkling water in the same glass throughout dinner service due to staff confusion.
- We were given some additional dishes during our meal including a bread basket and tapenade. Unfortunately several of these dishes didn't fit our dietary requirements. The staff were aware of our requirements prior to our arrival in the hotel and prior to dinner. This may be dangerous for guests with allergies. 
- The dishes provided to meet our dietary requirement (plant based) were pretty average. Breakfast is particularly poor with limited options if you follow a PB diet. 

It's clear that the restaurant staff are working incredibly hard but can't meet the demands of service with current levels of staffing. 

- Housekeeping issues - attended 3x on our second day to clean our room. On the first two attempts our bins were not emptied/bed not made."

Quarto muito confortável. Pequeno-almoço muito bom. Massagem no spa muito boa. cons: Staff desorganizado no serviço às mesas no restaurante (jantar e pequeno-almoço). O pequeno almoço é variado e muito bom mas pratos quentes (ovos sandes...) por menú ao pequeno-almoço revelou a desorganização do staff. São simpáticos mas nota-se ainda falta de formação do staff em geral. Piscina do spa muito pequena para o tamanho do resort. Apanhamos tempo encoberto e frio pelo que o meu filho queria ir para a piscina do spa claro mas infelizmente as crianças só podiam entrar na zona da piscina interior das 10h às 12h. Achei que no geral não é um hotel próprio para crianças mas mais para adultos que queiram muito silêncio e sossego. Se for isso que procura então é a escolha ideal.

Sempre dispostos a fazer mais para tornar a nossa estadia ainda mais memorável. Há muitos nomes que gostaria de mencionar mas a Rita do restaurante Azeitona fez das nossas refeições experiências de outro nível. cons: Até custa ""criticar"" uma estadia tão especial. Os únicos 2 pontos que foram menos positivos foram o SPA os tratamentos não foram exatamente o que procurávamos e a água da piscina estava mais fria do que era suposto. O segundo ponto foi a avaria da lareira no quarto e apesar do AC funcionar e manter o quarto quente não foi a mesma coisa. Infelizmente talvez por ser fim de semana não foi possível arranjar o problema durante a nossa estadia mas mesmo assim foram ambos assuntos compensados de outras formas."

As refeições são de qualidade embora com pouca variedade. cons: Claramente os acessos não são os melhores é um percurso de cerca 2 km em terra batida com buracos e lama quando chove (foi o caso) e inclusive o próprio estacionamento também é em terra batida e fica todo enlameado consequentemente o carro e o calçado.

O pequeno-almoço é pouco variado e exclusivamente à la carte.

Apesar da estadia já estar paga quando chegámos exigiram cartão de crédito (é um abuso). A alternativa era também surreal ter deixar uma caução em dinheiro. Num alojamento deste nível desconfiar dos clientes é um péssimo sinal.

O SPA fica aquém das expectativas nomeadamente a piscina interior que é minúscula (área) e também pouco profunda (de pé a água fica pela cintura). A zona de relaxamento também é muito pequena."

As instalações são excelentes e toda a envolvência do hotel.
O restaurante é fenomenal com comida muito bem confeccionada os meus parabéns.
Obrigada pelo miminho no quarto à chegada faziamos anos de casados e foi-nos oferecido uma garrafa de champanhe e um bolinho... muito obrigada pela atenção. cons: A estrada de acesso tal como já foi dito precisa de ser urgentemente melhorada.
Falta sinalética no hotel e o acesso à recepção como quem vem do parque de estacionamento com muita lama.
Spa confortável mas muito pequeno e com limpeza um pouco deficiente.
Falta mais privacidade nas janelas da casa de banho um rolo/cortina resolvia fácil.
Sugeria que repensassem o pequeno almoço e o ser servido à la Carte. Demora algum tempo e houve falhas nos pedidos. Estive mais de 20 minutos à espera que me servissem um café expresso. Na minha opinião e agora com a chegada do Verão onde irão ter mais hospedes justificava-se um sistema Buffet."

Num soft opening é de esperar que nem tudo funcione na perfeição no geral quase tudo foi perfeito e o que não estava de acordo com as nossas expectativas foi rapidamente resolvido pela gerente e com follow-up pelo diretor do hotel. De realçar ainda que o concierge via whatsapp funciona muito bem e é bastante eficaz.
As instalações do hotel são de um 5 estrelas com imenso conforto com muita qualidade em tudo o que servem e sempre com vontade no staff de tornar a experiência ainda melhor. Deixo ainda uma enorme satisfação pelo serviço de almoço num domingo de Páscoa no restaurante Azeitona com um menu muito português e com imensa qualidade. cons: O acesso ao hotel não é de fato o melhor e durante a primeira viagem até ao hotel ficamos na dúvida se estávamos na direção certa claro que depois de estar hospedado rapidamente estava esquecido o caminho em si mas é de fato o ponto onde há mais espaço por onde melhorar - a gestão do hotel referiu que colocarão indicações nas próximas semanas para garantir que isto não será um problema no futuro.
Numa nota mais pessoal preferimos pequenos almoço que combinem o buffet com o menu. Tudo o que é servido no menu é de enorme qualidade mas é sempre bom ter a opção de compôr com o acesso ao buffet.
Nota: nenhum destes pontos manchou esta estadia."

The hotel is huge especially with less guests because it’s off season. Unfortunately the golf course is on renovation so the view is not that pretty I bet it would once the grass has grown. The staffs are very polite and helpful. Cleaning was on point - they come visit during the evening too to ask if you needed fresh towels or more toiletries. Buffet breakfast was okay. Ria Restaurant serves delicious meals (try their sea bass; and the bread that comes with the king prawns are to die for!) plus the staffs are very attentive and Botanic Cocktail Bar makes amazing cocktails and very instagram worthy! Huge pools. Room with pool view is aesthetically pleasing. Comfortable beds. Lounge-sofa in the Balcony! Everything you expect for a 5 star hotel - room is provided! And last but not the least we were allowed to do a late checkout at no cost - since it’s off season. Thank you for that! cons: I asked for a double bed; they gave us two single beds.

Unfortunately the golf course was being renovated and looked just like a construction site. This was not mentioned to us and if we would have known we would have changed our travel plans. But the hotel offered us a complimentary upgrade to a suite with pool view and that was very nice. In the end the construction site didn't bother us that much at all.

Meal portions and quality served at the pool bars were also a nice surprise. cons: Being charged for 8€ for 1l still water while dining at the Victoria restaurant (imo there’s no need to do it in such a product increase the price of a glass of wine for example - paid 9€ and 11€ for two Portuguese red). 
The bedroom TV service is very slow.
Reserve done to the “adults only” section of the hotel and then getting a room upgrade that was actually to the “non adults only” section (which was not communicated during the check-in).

Second stay and would return again. cons: Had issues with the screen cast to watch movies and sink pipes seemed to be stuck but staff sorted it. Not crazy about the food options at the pool need more variety. Also very expensive for food and drinks at the pool a lot higher than typical Portuguese prices. I think it’s €4 for a soft drink can and for basic ice creams. We were surprised at the sister hotel the Tivoli they gave out free snacks and ice creams and it’s less expensive than this hotel.

It’s a fantastic hotel really great quality so great that it’s split between family friendly side and adult only side (which we were on). The room was so clean and nice and felt luxury. The pool was fantastic so clean and we loved the pool bar with excellent food it was exactly all we needed to relax on a babymoon and just loved it. The breakfast was so great one of the best hotel breakfast buffets we’ve had in a very long time and we travel a lot! Great underground safe car park with easy access up to rooms or lobby. For any golf lovers this is right on an incredible golf course and generally the hotel grounds are so well kept and lovely.
It’s about 20-25min drive from Vale do lobo and Quinta do lago and we just drove to them each night for dinner out where there’s such a huge selection. 
We really couldn’t fault the hotel generally the staff are so friendly and we had everything and more that we wanted to just chill out for 5 days. cons: Do you really need a car to make the most to access the beaches and restaurants nearby but we hired a car for our trip and it was super easy. The slightly further out from VDL/QDL location meant the price was lower and I’d take that any day of the week given Anantara’s great quality compared to some of the closer hotels. 

The hotel restaurant options were on the pricier side but it wasn’t really an issue as we just then went out to various restaurants for dinners which were nearby and fantastic."

We asked the staff to bring our suites from the room to the car by the check out and we went to spa at that time.  When we finish and got into the car  I wanted to change clothes and  go to the trunk to take the necessary thing but the suitcases were not there. Once I didn’t want to change the clothes we will leave the hotel without our staff. 
The shower was moldy  some doors at the room closed with creaking sound. 
Live music promised every evening  happened from time to time. Food at the restaurants are overpriced as the taste is mediocre and very salty. Generally hotel is fine but minding all that the price should be lower."

Breakfast bar to die for
Spa treatments superb cons: We had only one complaint The DJ music at the adult pool is way too loud and not appropriate we felt. The morning music is so relaxing thank you.
I think it would be great to have a water font to refill your bottle around the pool area... We drink alot of water and it was beautifully hot when we were there in August"

We were only meant to stay one night and go to another hotel. But ended up checking out and checking back in because we enjoyed the first day so much. Lovely shuttle to the Marina. Will definitely be back. All the staff were great. Loved breakfast. Games room for the kids. cons: Only negative was the buffet dinner at €65pp and a party of 9 the bill was huge and the food was really disappointing we barely had one plate each so that burned on the first night.

Nice to see that the pool adult areas are policed and kept free from kids. cons: Our room was not serviced until late (after 4-5pm) for 3 out of 4 days. It wasn’t consistent with sometimes items provided and sometimes not. Suggest you either take the Gnocchi of the menu or make them yourself as presently they are like rubber. The main courses in the Asian restaurant were very flavoursome but only slightly warm."

All the staff were friendly and helpful and we really didnt want for anything. Breakfast was a highlight for my other half who is very demanding about these things! Plenty of choice freshly cooked options and a delightful terrace to sit out on. We ate pool side a couple of lunchtimes which I really enjoyed too - extremely tasty food lots of choice and a great wine selection. We didnt eat dinner in any of the restaurants but I'm sure they are good. Love the shuttle service! The pool area is comfortable and spacious and I like the addition of regular visits from staff with water and snacks! cons: Honestly I couldnt fault it - i wish the weather was better but not sure the hotel can accommodate that kind of request!

From the modern luxurious rooms to the breakfast options we were blown away. The staff were welcoming and couldn’t do enough to make our stay special. One thing I really appreciated was the availability of gluten free options for food and how knowledgeable the staff were. As a Coelaic traveller this can be tricky but here I felt at ease right away. cons: Service in the bar was quite slow on both occasions we ate there but the food was exceptional. Use of the spa facilities like the pool and sauna was free for members but had to be booked which means that a spontaneous visit isn’t possible.

Shout out to the staff especially Paul from Germany and Carla who checked us in great representation of the hotel. cons: Our stay was fantastic however here are some of our experiences; The drive to Vilamoura is 10 to 15 minutes the driver was driving fast on two occasions I had to ask him to slow down as it was making my wife ill. There’s an engine management light on the vehicle which needs addressed. Our Prosecco glasses to the room had lipstick on them. The hotel is a large complex and requires 5-8 mins to reach reception (depending on room) The restaurants and shops were closed during our stay in December. However the staff made everything great.

The service from the staff was amazing and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were super spacious and clean we loved the fact we had a walk-in wardrobe and sun loungers on our terrace. The pool area was lovely it got the sun all day and there were always plenty of loungers. The gardens and views of the golf course were stunning. The spa was definitely worth going to and so was the Sensai restaurant. The breakfast was included in the room price and there was so much choice I am gluten free and they had a whole section (with bread and muffins - as well as the cooked breakfast) which is rare when staying away. Another great touch was that there was a free shuttle bus that would take you between the hotel and Vilamoura free of charge. I would 100% recommend this hotel it really did feel 5* and we will be back! cons: It might have been nice to have some background music around the pool but honestly other than that I couldn’t fault a thing

The pools are great beautiful and together with the fact that they are heated brings the comfort at any time of the day no matter the weather. Also the comfort of the room fantastic. The pool's bar staff nice attentive and effective. The check out went well as well. Very nice breakfast. cons: The experience didn't start well with a long check-in time specially with one counter off which was just open after 20min. I'd say that three or four people I've crossed with at the front desk was not a great experience. Then the breakfast organization and the service didn't go well either. Honestly I believe the staff is not prepared for the Anantara standard. I've been in many in different places and it always exceeded any kind expectation bringing a great experience. The only thing I've got on the arriving to the hotel was tension. Not a good service at all. A final note to the maintenance of the deck around the pool and to the very warm lights on the floor around the pool (trees lightning) anyone who accidentally steps on that will get hurt.

An excellent relaxing experience from start to finish of the week we stayed. We loved the room the hotel pools the adult only pool the spa facilities the hotel restaurant (we did the tasting menu with wine pairing which we found excellent) excellent breakfast with freshly prepared variety of eggs daily and the very helpful staff. The shuttle service to and from Vilamoura is efficient and a lovely touch. cons: Struggle to think of anything I disliked about this hotel. The hotel lacks atmosphere and entertainment at night but I suppose that is easily got in Vilamoura marina.

There are 2 electric chargers in the parking totally free. Great hotel chain overall knowing it was pricey. cons: Hotel is huge and a bit pricey but we are also in the high season. Maintenance could be better (some areas around the hotel can be improved). It has 300 rooms and it was a bit ""packed"". Sometimes it was difficult to find a spot by the pool.

The rooms are spacious and clean breakfast is amazing the staff are so attentive and friendly and the pool areas with loungers are the best we’ve seen. I know some people were saying the food and drink round the pool was expensive but we were paying similar prices on the marina and so we didn’t have any issue with that. The free shuttle you can take to the marina and call to bring you back is a brilliant addition. cons: Having been there 5 years ago (and the prices going up since then) we expected everything to be as good and even though we had a great time I’m not sure it was. They used to have a pool attendant who took you to your lounger with towels and whilst that may seem over the top it eliminated people putting towels down on loungers they didn’t use for hours. Some mornings towels were reserving loungers before 9am and then not being used until early afternoon which is ridiculous. Everyone we spoke to had the same compliant we mentioned it to the staff but it was clear when they’re busy serving drinks and food all day they can’t be expected to notice how long someone has or hasn’t been on a lounger.  A polite warning at checkin that loungers can’t be reserved all day is really all it would take to limit this happening.

The gym was a reasonable size and did the job. We went in early May so there were always loungers and beds available however I imagine there might be more of a bun fight for loungers in the busier summer season. 

Complimentary prosecco in the lobby and shuttle to the harbour were lovely touches. cons: Reception staff lacked warmth and so the checking in and checking out processes were  oddly clinical experiences but the pool bar lobby bar and breakfast service staff were all very accomodating and friendly. 

I was disappointed that despite mentioning it a few times the hotel did nothing to acknowledge my dad's 70th birthday. This was a first for me with any hotel I've stayed in and I've stayed in many. Usually a complimentary bottle or cake/dessert are left in the room. One breakfast staff was kind enough to wish him a happy birthday after I put a happy birthday banner on the breakfast table. Overall a decent hotel but perhaps lacking that human touch in key areas."

It was a pleasure to go there. Very well spent money. Also have to praise staff from the Palms and a very high praise for the breakfast staff. We met Jose and Luis which I believe could be supervisor/manager and other staff members that I'm afraid I don't remember the name. Jose made sure we tried detox juices brought us whatever coffee we wanted with pastries to try. It was refreshing watching all of them work and how they were smiling happy  accommodating everyone's request. A very well done to them! cons: In general the thing I really was a bit sad about is that the hotel is not adults only. The amount of screaming and running around was bit too much for me as I went for a relaxing SPA break. Sometimes I wasn't relaxed at all. Another thing I have to mention which was very disappointing was our dinner at EMO. Service did not match my expectations it was very poor. Me and my daughter ordered drinks as appetizers and after that no one came to the table to suggest wine or ask if we wanted anything else to drink. Considering that you have a sommelier it was disappointing. When I asked if I could have wine I was answered abruptly yes of course. I also asked why wasn't the couvert plates removed as there wasn't anything else to eat and the staff said that unless I ask it stays until the end of the meal. Why would I have a dirty plate on my table if I'm not eating from it... I was offered a meat sushi to try which was very good but the girl never asked if I liked it! when I said to her it was very tasty she replied good! On the plus side they were kind to offer glass of wine as this was my daughters birthday dinner. There were times there was no staff in sight Overall it took us 2h to eat we were cold and didn't want to be there anymore. Not good value for money at all.

Staff were all very friendly and attentive though we did get cleaning staff knocking on our day around 9pm for 'turn down' which we weren't used to. The kids pool area was great (adult pool was closed when we went) and the cocktail bar fantastic with lovely staff. All in all a great experience and we would definitely go back ! cons: The evening buffet was quite expensive.

The food is good with breakfast being the highlight. cons: The golf course (which is being re-done) is basically the view of the whole hotel and pool area. I knew the course was being developed but didn’t realise it’s about 50m from the pool and your entire view - it will be nice when it’s done. There was also a huge conference when we were there (weren’t made aware at check in just received a note under our door) and you could definitely tell all staff were catering to them over other guests for example it didn’t feel like the pool was even going to open/be serviced one of the days. We ordered room service and it felt like an inconvenience for the woman who delivered it. Definitely not 5* service or hotel.

Good pool good vibe overall in the hotel. Everything was nice and clean and the cleaning staff makes sure your room stays top notch and clean as well. cons: this is already quite an upper level hotel financially what is annoying that becomes visible after 2-3 days is that they will 1. Charge you for almost everything extra (spa is not included) 2. Their pricess are ridiculously high (17.50 EUR for 1 badly made irish coffee 6 Eur for a glass of water 5 eur for 1 cola etc.) 3. They automatically assume you will tip on EVERY EXPENSE that you make if you don't say anything about that before checking out you'll easily spend 100-150 on 'hidden tips'. 4. They will literally to the annoying level start to ask if you want anything to drink and even if you say no they persist with 'are you sure'.

Toilet roll holder broke chargers broke. Chips of wood taken off the coffee tables. Not 5 star in rooms.

Good gym.
Breakfast staff very friendly and a great selection of food.
Front of house staff at check in were very friendly and this was an easy process. cons: It was fine but certainly not a 5 star resort.
For the room cleaning it just seemed like a very quick once over and sometimes towels and amenities like shower gel (empty) were not replaced. One time we were still in the room in the morning when the cleaner arrived and asked them to come back later (left shortly after) and by 5pm it had still not been cleaned.
Asked for the broken hairdryer to be replaced but it never was.
Pool staff were not over friendly and sometimes it was a very long wait for drinks to arrive (15-20 mins - it was busy but not excessively so).
More guests than pool loungers available.
Hotel layout was confusing and easy to get lost.
Quite expensive to stay here and then had to pay €25 if you wanted to use the indoor pool/sauna - seems excessive.
If this was advertised as a 3/4 star resort then I probably wouldnt have written this much but little things you would expect from a 5 star resort were missing."

In the morning there was NO hot water for shower. When we called them they said that there is an issue in the hotel and it should be fixed within an hour.
Not just this terrible service but also there was a wedding at the hotel during our stay with loud music until the night and the hotel didn’t even mention this anywhere.
The hotel and restaurants are overpriced e.g. we had to pay for a bottle of water - 8€.

Main lounge bar was really lovely. The bar staff staff at breakfast and the staff working around the pool were all absolutely fantastic. cons: With a small baby in a pram there was a lot of up and down in lifts to get to where we needed to go throughout the day. 
There were a lot of renovation works going on that we were not made aware of prior to our visit. 
There was a distinct lack of communication from the reception team and I found the reception team unwelcoming I’m not I have come to expect from staying in a luxury. Kids Club wasn’t explained to us and we weren’t even told where it was located. We had a pool access room which we had paid an extra thousand pounds for an access to. It was not explained to us. 
My biggest issue and unfortunately the reason why we will be cancelling our summer booking was that our rooms were riddled with cockroaches. I did report the issue to reception after the first day of this happening and we were promised a deep clean which one of our rooms was but the other wasn’t. I also reported a cockroach in the corridor leading to one of the restaurants and the same cockroach was under the bench in the same place for at least four days. While I understand that in hot countries you have to expect insects I have never stayed in a five star establishment where I have seen any!"

The rooms are spacious and have a good design. The staff made the stay for me without them it would have been poor. Edgar in the gin bar was great along with all the other staff there. cons: I asked for a double room during my stay but was given a twin room with beds pushed together. I asked for a double but there was nothing available.
The location of the hotel is quite remote with no other bars or restaurants close by everything is a drive away.
I didn't realise that half the hotel was closed during my stay I probably should have read right to the bottom of the booking page.
The gym was quite poor for a 5 star hotel including no spin bike. It only had a few pieces of equipment in not great.
One of the pools was closed and the sauna and steam room were closed not great again. This meant a shuttle ride to a sister hotel 20 minutes away to use the sauna/spa facilities.
There was only one restaurant and one bar option in the evening and because there were no other local bars/restaurants there was no other option. I also found the prices to be highly inflated so avoided eating and drinking in the hotel as much as possible.
I paid 8 euros for a cold coffee by the pool and 4.50 euros for a small bottle of water! This was way too much so I avoided eating and drinking there. I would recommend eating and drinking out as it was at least half the price elsewhere for the same quality if not better.
The lobby bar could be improved by some music or atmosphere it was quite devoid of any real vibe. 
Overall it was an adequate experience as the rate was reduced. As a solo guest it was a tough stay with very little to do. Luckily I had a car so I left the hotel most days. This defeats the object of having a nice hotel to stay in! I would not visit again just due to the negative points outweighing the positive during my stay."

Golf course next door is great! cons: Service at this hotel was not that of a 5 star by some margin. There was no personal element to it at all. For example when we arrived we were rushed through check in no welcome drink was offered and despite travelling with a 3 month old baby they were not able to offer our room or any baby facilities earlier than 2pm (we arrived at 10). There was a constant battle for sun beds round the pool so when we arrived we couldn’t even get a seat at the pool whilst we waited for our room. The food in the buffet restaurant for dinner was average and for 50 euro a head was very over priced for buffet dinner. Sensai the a la carte restaurant was nice but pretty average considering  the hotels supposed 5 star rating. Due to the baby one night we decided to stay in and order room service for dinner and food was bland and took over half an hour to get through just to order. My husband also complained his back hurt and after inspection we noted the mattress was very passed its sell by date. This Coupled with a general air of not caring about guest experience by the staff (except for the cascades pool bar staff here and manager was great) I could at best say this hotel was 4star and would not reccomend it. The shuttle service to vilamoura was also badly organised.

Had to take the shuttle for everything. One of our family members decided to extend the stay for a day (from 5 days to 6 days). Reception offered a very high rate for the additional night stating high-season. They did not consider it important that the guest was already spending 5 nights with them!. The person moved to different hotel. The hotel had still unsold rooms when we checked online on booking.com on the planned day of extended stay. The hotel lost revenue. Perhaps front desk staff should be given more freedom to decide on rates especially when a guest is already staying for 5 nights and is spending so much money on the hotel.

Reception staff were average (the lady at check in left us to figure out what we do with a sleeping child and 3 pieces of luggage when we checked in at 10pm). WiFi is very poor we had none in our room - we complained and someone came to check. Clearly it was determined it’s too much faff to fix so nothing was done (we stayed a week so this was a real problem). The whole breakfast area is full of flies on the food at the tables it’s quite alarming. The shuttle to the town is a sham too never arrives before 30 mins if it arrives at all! We have stayed at other Anantara properties and their service was impeccable. This property is shambolic in comparison.

Also it could’ve been the time of the year we went over Easter but the lack of food options (a number of restaurants were closed) and no supermarkets in the area meant you’re stuck with either a 50 euros pp buffet or a fine dining restaurant every day - we ended up ordering room service a few tables as it was the only affordable option which I rarely do in a hotel.

Having stayed in many hotels in the Algarve I was disappointed this is absolutely not a 5 star hotel; 4 star at best and that is being generous. If you are looking for luxury this isn’t it.

Lamento profundamente. Porque depois todo o Staff é de uma simpatia extrema.
Também gostaria de realçar que se notou do ano para para este ano  uma melhoria acentuada na generalidade dos serviços e na manutenção do Hotel . cons: O Hotel é incapaz de fazer um agrado a um cliente mesmo que esse cliente seja um cliente frequente. Pedimos para deixar o quarto um pouco mais tarde e a desculpa é sempre a MESMA (todos os anos) o seu quarto já tem um cliente para entrar. Mas caso pretendesse reservar mais uma noite aí já podia ficar com o mesmo quarto . Lamentável. Direção comercial deveria começar a dar mais atenção aos clientes frequentes Portugueses e não só aos estrangeiros."

Bella Vista is truly a remarkable property offering a blend of beauty and comfort. Here are some highlights from my experience:

- **Accommodations**: The main building features stunning rooms with a captivating color palette and views of the sea. The ambiance is simply breathtaking. While the next building has more standard rooms the service remains excellent.

- **Service**: The staff were attentive and genuinely concerned about my well-being regarding my lower back issue. Their efforts made a significant difference during my stay.

- **Dining**: The food at Bella Vista is exceptional with a Michelin star to its name. Each meal was a delightful experience showcasing culinary excellence.

- **Overall Impression**: Despite some minor concerns about pricing the overall experience was unforgettable. Bella Vista is a place I would love to revisit thanks to its wow factor and the warmth of its team.

In summary Bella Vista is a destination that combines stunning views excellent service and remarkable dining making it a must-visit for anyone seeking a memorable getaway. cons: Staff hesitated too much for some extra .."

It took us a little under 3 hours to get there from Lisbon airport which was a breeze. The rooms were a decent size but the view was absolutely stunning. There really isn't much reason to leave the hotel and here's why.

On the first night we dined at the Michelin-starred restaurant which was an experience in itself. Don't be discouraged by the serving sizes—trust me you'll be full by the end of the meal. We chose the wine pairing from Portugal which was amazing. Each dish was sensational.

On the second day we decided to rent a boat with Thalassa Yachts on the recommendation of the hotel concierge. We were not disappointed. We spent $700 on a stunning beautiful yacht for a half-day complete with wine and cheese! Highly recommend this—it is very much worth it. We heard that further down the coast the pricing was three times this.

For dinner on the third day we tried to get into Reis de Praias Restaurant also known as King of the Beach but we couldn’t get a reservation. It's important to book early as the view here is stunning and it seems you can spend the day there. We ended up at Ferragudo Terrace which was excellent!

We also wanted a high-end luxury nightclub experience for adults 30+ so we recommend YOU which was about a 45-minute drive but worth it. They had some very well-known DJs and an elevated crowd.

Last but not least the food at Bela Vista's pool and dining (not Michelin) was delightful. We loved the codfish cakes—they were so good that we ordered them everywhere else we went but none compared to Bela Vista's. For dinner the sea bass in salt crust was outstanding.

That's all I have for this amazing trip! cons: "

From the moment we walked in and until the moment we checked out the service and attention to detail was top notch. Our room was spotless and the view was amazing. We relaxed by the pool and the hotel even had their own access to the beach. One of the highlights of our stay was dinner at their Vista restaurant. What an experience! We can’t wait to come back next summer! cons: Our only negative comment is that we didn’t stay longer.

These features seemed to be the main selling points rather than what one might otherwise expect in a luxury hotel at this price point. The staff were great and couldn’t have been more helpful. We loved the buffet breakfast offering served in a dining room with spectacular ocean views. Ask for the scrumptious eggs Benedict option! The evening Bistro dining options are delicious if somewhat on the pricey side. cons: We didn’t like that the main dinner option was a 2 star Michelin offering with very expensive tasting only menus and no a la carte - no meat and no choice for the diner. Our upgraded room was quite small with very limited storage for a one week stay. We had to ask them to take away some of the bedding and decorative items to create a little extra space and comfort.

The amenities were perfect. The staff couldn’t be better. So attentive and helpful and st your be king call. Having never experienced this before I almost felt uncomfortable at how well taken care of we were. Only because I’m not used to those kind of experiences.

The bed was incredibly comfortable. I ate dinner at Vista (their Michelin starred restaurant) which was amazing. The staff were extremely attentive in Vista and the food was outstanding. The pool is well maintained. It is quiet with a good service for food and drinks available all day. The breakfast was also good. cons: There were 3 occasions when I ordered something from the bar/cafe by the pool and the order was completely forgotten. I had to ask again for my order. I booked a 90 minute massage and 90 facial in the spa. The massage was lovely but the facial was very rough and completely undid the relaxation I had experienced in the massage. The hotel is situated in the centre of town on the main road. The nightclubs and bars are still going at 4am so you will hear this from your room.

Breakfast was delicious. The spa was excellent. We had the couples massage and it was the best massage we both had for a long time. The Michelin star restaurant was a once in a lifetime experience. The food was exceptional and the service also exceptional. It was interesting to see the kitchen and wine cellar beforehand. Nice touch of head chef Joao to present one of the dishes to us at our table. The cocktails at the bar were fantastic prepared by Paolo. The food in the more casual restaurant was excellent also. On the hottest day it was lovely to lay out beside the outdoor pool. There was a short walk to the beach. The beach is beautiful for walks and very refreshing to swim in also. The hotel is gated and accessed with keycard only so we felt safe at all times. We were on our honeymoon (postponed from 2019) and there were some nice touches like a bottle of champagne in our room along with strawberries and some treats.  As kids under 12 are not allowed it helps to make the hotel quieter and more relaxing. Close by we really enjoyed Restaurant F which is a blue and white quiet restaurant upstairs off the main street. Our sheets were changed every morning and there was a turn down service every evening. We would definitely stay in the hotel again and we look forward to it. cons: Just a note for next time not a complaint. We rented a car and drove to the hotel. In hindsight everything is in the town Praia da Rocha. There is a decent shop a few yards from the hotel along with lots of restaurants and bars and a pharmacy a short walk away. So we could have gotten a shuttle organised by the hotel or an Uber or taxi from Faro airport and avoided the €15 a day charge for parking in the hotel.

The interior design is clearly the result of thoughtful curation with every corner showcasing meticulous attention to detail and a refined aesthetic. The Occitane spa offered unique treatments including a particularly effective one aimed at resetting sleep which we really enjoyed. The pool area was stunning complemented by well-curated music and excellent drinks making it a highlight of our stay. cons: While the hotel is beautifully designed several aspects left much to be desired. The location though central resulted in a crowded beach view marred by ongoing construction and a lot of noise. The hotel lacks its own setup on the beach with dedicated beds or amenities - this could be a great addition to enjoy more than just an ocean view. The staff while well-trained often came across as insincere which affected the overall atmosphere. Additionally the small room size and difficulty securing reservations at their Michelin-starred restaurant—even with weeks of waitlist and being guests of the hotel—added to the frustration. Unfortunately our experience was further compromised by severe food poisoning at the pool restaurant which was handled with minimal concern as we were merely directed to a nearby pharmacy and still charged in full. Dietary preferences were also overlooked as my breakfast included pork despite explicitly informing the staff that I do not eat that on arrival (this was quickly corrected but we expected more from the 5* boutique facility). The concierge’s recommendations were similarly disappointing; we were told there were no quieter beaches nearby only to discover one 20 minutes away ourselves. Altogether these issues compounded into a less-than-ideal experience and with some attention to detail and genuine hospitality these could be addressed to better serve future guests.

Most of the rooms are not in the luxury main building but in two others  far of 5* confort. The ocean view is affected by beach restaurats and their toilets. Nothing of this is suggested by well chosen words of description artistic photos or smart association with trusted brands like Michelin Occitane or Relais&Chateaux. The reality is different of what marketing strategy makes you believe  for a price almost double comparing with the closest 5*hotel.

The only positive thing I can say is that the breakfast was nice and so is the ocean view from the outside area (not from the room). Also the hotel has a gym which is helpful if you want to get a workout done during your stay. Yet none of these things would be reason enough to ever return or recommend this place to someone as I know enough other places with amazing views great breakfasts and gym facilities. cons: 1) The place is not as idyllic as the pictures show. The inside of the main building is nice but not very well illuminated. There are 3 buildings in total and you might not stay in the main building if you book a room - which is already a step down in quality and feel of your vacation. In addition the hotel location is awful and in the moment you step out of the hotel you’re faced with multiple souvenir shops and low end small restaurants which are completely in disharmony with the „luxurious“ experience the hotel is trying to sell. The pool area is also faced to the city so even in your moment of relaxation you cannot escape the skyscrapers and busyness of the outside of the hotel. Of course this is nothing the hotel can do anything against but I think it is important to consider before choosing your destination in the Algarve.
2) Overall NOT good value for money - paid a lot for ocean view and I got a very small room where I could not place my luggage on the floor and walk in the room at the same time. The room was also in a side building (not the main building you see in the pictures) and my ocean view was a small window (not even 1m wide) view to a parking lot with the ocean behind it. The shower did not have appropriate heating and the decoration of the room seemed not very sophisticated and rather childlike (nautical theme).
3) In our first evening we were not able to get a reservation in the hotel restaurant. We then we asked if we could order room service and eat in the inside restaurant or outside by the pool - or whichever place that could be outside of our room so we would not have to eat inside in the first night in the hotel but the staff was not flexible nor helpful. So we had to have room service in our first night stay which is simply unacceptable at such a high end place.
4)In the second night we were finally able to get a reservation at the bistro restaurant and I have no words."

A delicious welcome drink
A spacious room
Easy parking close to entrance
Nice lounge area to enjoy a drink
Good breakfast
Beautiful building cons: No sockets near bed or on the desk
No socket in the bathroom. Receptionist told us it was forbidden in Portugal but we had a socket in the bathroom in every other Portuguese hotel.
The white furniture in the room looked quite cheap and awful.
The classic chairs in the lounge were tired looking and uncomfortable.
We found it very strange to see the reception in the chapel while there seemed to be a much better reception area which was used for Roman artifacts from a museum.
Large bedrooms with no atmosphere and dated design."

There were three when I was there. The first two - Liverpool and then Irish - were fine. The last one was a very large group of Flemish speaking Belgians. They were incredibly loud and spent the time around the pool shouting at each other. Left pool towels and glasses strewn all over the place. Not relaxing at all when they were there  and they were there for three days. I get that the weddings are good business but .......

1. For a 5-star hotel some renovation is needed here and there
2. A bit odd having to additionally ask for a bathrobe
3. At breakfast having to take a cup from the  table where you are seated to go to another room to pour tea or coffee

The reception and main rooms are exquisite.   You can use any of the main rooms any time although the chairs being in keeping with the period are not that comfortable LOL.  Great ambience.  Excellent pool (getting a pool towel on the other hand more of a challenge!).  Basic gym.  Outstanding breakfast.  Easy parking.  Excellent staff.  We loved our stay here (we stayed in a superior view room on the 2nd floor with a terrace looking down to Faro (and a lot of grass).  Yes the building is VERY OLD which means that in a few places the paint is peeling etc.  There was also some refurbishment work done in the reception (old chapel ) while we were there.  This did nothing to detract from my enjoyment but if you worry about that sort of thing don't stay. cons: View from terrace is good but the grass gets in the way a bit.  Getting a pool towel was a challenge - apparently I should have told them that I wanted the one in the room replaced after it was taken away (seriously?  some people stay for a week and don't want it replaced??????).

The breakfast was the best hotel breakfast I've had in my life - mimosas fresh cheeses freshly baked bread and pastry (in a tiny village)

The swimming pool with the VIEW was out of this world and I had it all to myself all day on Christmas Day.  there is a small heated indoor pool and sauna / Turkish bath.  I generally don't fancy those facilities but they were terrific

I was able to enjoy the Roman ruins in the near by and the small museum was a thrill.  Art Works were along the large corridors.  It was more than a hotel - it was a hotel with a connection to local history.

Of course the original building and gardens were terrific and it was lovely to stay someplace so fancy.

the staff couldn't have been more helpful.  Everybody did their best and worked through Christmas without complaint

I typically don't go back to the same place twice but if I would ever revisit a hotel it would be this treasure.  The place is actually nicer than the photos presented (many of the guests though the photos didn't do it justice) cons: to plug in my lap top I had to craw underneath the desk to find the plug socket.   

The best bedrooms are on the higher floors (better view) and I began to wonder if solo travellers were allocated lower floors rooms automatically.  Another solo traveller must have researched the hotel better than I and when he was allocated a similar room to me he asked to be moved to a room with a view (I checked in late and night).  I paid the same for my room as any couple paid to share their room but I'm conscious that people might have a bias in favour of couples (people who are in a couple might think giving a couple a room with a better view is acceptable).  I didn't think to raise this on check out but I booked my room in September.  Many others booked in December.   Surely the rooms with the better views would be allocated on a first come / first served basis?  As a solo traveller I'm very conscious that there is a strange sense of entitlement benefiting domesticated couples ."

We have traveled all over the world and we would rank this breakfast as a 10! The sauna was a great perk and was most enjoyable near by our room. cons: No coffee maker in the room.  Since we are early risers and the breakfast room doesn't open until 8 am we found it disappointing not having coffee in our room.  This property is located in a very tiny country town so there isn't an option to go to a cafe or coffee shop either.

We loved exploring the grounds and gardens. The hotel was pretty quiet when we were there (November) and felt like we had it to ourselves which we loved. The breakfast really was exceptional and had us set for our day. Everything was clean and comfortable. The pool and steam/sauna rooms were such a lovely treat! The hotel staff were very kind and attentive. We appreciated the little details such as having water and apple to take on our way out the door.

There were options to dine within a short drive and plenty to see and do along the coast very close by. cons: We wish the pool steam/sauna rooms were open a little later so we could have enjoyed after a day of exploring the area!"

Perfect for a quiet weekend away and just 20 minutes drive from the airport. cons: There is very little in Estoi village so if you want to eat out or go for drinks you will need to go to Faro or one of the adjoining towns.

Perfect for a quiet weekend but if you're staying for longer than that or looking for vibrant nightlife then this probably isn't the place for you.

I was just looking for a comfortable stop over for me and my family. Based on the price and the photos on Booking.com I wasn't expecting anything particularly special. However Pousada Palacio de Estoi delivered a luxury experience and level of surface that really exceeded my expectations.   The photos don't do the hotel justice - it's a mix of modern and historic and both feel very well kept and upscale.  I was impressed by the staff - at the front desk pool side and at breakfast - who delivered the kind of professional and attentive service you'd expect from a hotel charging double.  We requested a late checkout.  The hotel couldn't accommodate that but let us use the facilities - like the wonderful pool area - for as long as we wanted on checkout day. cons:

The gardens of the palace are magnificent 
and the village of Estoi is charming and is an authentic Poetugese village. The Church in the square is magnificent! cons: The entrance street to the hotel doesn't create a great first impression for its guests. It's a great pity that the authorities in the Town can't jointly make improvements here along with the Pestana Group. It's shortsighted of the powers that be in the town not to realise that investment in this infrastructure would be a good investment as the town benefits so much from having this beautiful hotel at its centre."

Setting is stunning. 
Bar staff very knowledgeable good with wine recommendations and descriptions. cons: Check in was a little chaotic lots of printed papers all over the desk with guests booking details.
There was no access to the main gardens via the iron gates unless you walk through town unsure why that is but a shame as night time strolls would have been nice.

The rooms are spacious. The staff is very friendly and pay great attention to customers. Very nice breakfast! There’s a bar at the pool offering hot and cold beverages ice cream and even burgers and soups. we used the hotel as a base for visiting Algarve but you can easily spend a few days here. cons: we stayed 5 nights and on our first evening we found garbage on the property and told the reception about it. When we left the garbage was still there. For a 5star hotel this should not be tolerated. In the parking garage there was one garbage bin that was already full when we arrived and it wasn’t emptied until we left (the other was though).

The room was very clean and very comfortable and a large size. The breakfast was incredible with lots of options. The grounds of the hotel and the original parts of the palace are beautifully renovated and maintained. We were always able to get a lounger by the pool. We took a taxi to Faro for a day trip which was about 15 euros each way. cons: We hadn't arranged a reservation with the restaurant for dinner in advance and were unable to get a table on a weekday night. We were offered a seat at the bar and the staff were as accommodating as possible but we ended up eating elsewhere.

Clean spacious room helpful staff we had dinner there too and was very good especially local Cataplana  dish.

There is small local restaurant in Estoi where you should try grilled fish. Walking distance are Roman ruins. cons: Gardens will need more care as they look more abandon."

The pool area is nice - a bit small but good for this boutique-sized hotel. cons: The hotel restauring had poor food reviews and the menu was very unusual so we didn't eat there.  This was a shame as I feel it's a missed opportunity for the hotel as there's not many places in which to eat in Estoi.

The hotel was booked out for a private party on the day we were departing and we were unable to use the pool after midday.  We didn't discover this until after breakfast that day when we were going out for a walk when we noticed a sign at the pool entrance.  I feel we should have been informed of this the previous evening so we could have had an early morning swim - as it turned out we couldn't use the pool at all that day."

Nice large room in a purpose built modern accommodation block with air con . cons: Lunch time menu same as evening menu and quite limiting choices .
Had a coffee cup given with large lipstick stain so lacked attention to detail I would expect from this quality of hotel .

Small  reception area with only one staff member so quite a wait to check in (15 minutes )

Loved that we could leave our luggage at the reception and walk around even if we arrived before the designated  check-in time. Most of the staff are super kind and friendly. cons: One gentleman taking care of us for dinner seemed a bit neglectful. We were never asked if we wanted another drink or any desert after the main course. Seemed like we were given less attention than any other table around us.

Setting was quirky. Breakfast was generous and of good quality. cons: Quite an unwelcome and slow check-in as staff member scrutinised our Covid documentation and told us that we would have to go to breakfast before 9.00 am the next morning as our 48 hours post-testing ran out. Suspect this was not right but went along with a strong sense of general gate-keeping!

Great terrace and location is great close to Faro. Nice view of Faro and surrounding area. Breakfast buffet was great a lot of sweet and savory options (though no meat options outside pork). Lovely and helpful staff. cons: Still enjoyable but outdated spa area needs refurbishment. The outdoor pool isn't heated so the water is freezing cold such a pity. The Christmas eve menu was slightly overpriced (90€ per person wine included) but I appreciated the gesture to reduce the bill since I don't drink alcohol. It would be great to have some milk with the English breakfast tea bags. Kettle is available but on demand. No iron in the room. Bedside sockets are under the table so you literally need to crawl to plug something.

We stayed 2 nights and the same discarded water bottles were left on the floor of the terrace the same tables not wiped down. Getting the attention of staff for a coffee during breakfast was painful. 
I requested an extra bed and my messages ignored twice so I drove the hour from my home the week before my stay to ensure we would have this and still when we arrived we were told no request had been received. 
The staff did not seem to be very helpful in general I got married on the Saturday during my stay and returned after the ceremony in full wedding dress and staff did not even bother to say congratulations or hold the door open (we had our arms full). Little things like this really let the hotel down. I found the bed’s uncomfortable and the room very cold so had to get blankets from the wardrobe (I don’t know how clean they were I would have thought a hotel with 5 stars would have duvets?). The garden outside our terrace was very unkept and a little overgrown . Water was not replenished on the second night but it was for other guests staying at the hotel so lack of consistency there"

We came to spend two days in a small luxury hotel peaceful and beautiful. But we were faced with rude staff in the bar. We were with a small dog and asked ahead about the possibility to take him to the bar (only on the terrace) in a special carriage. But the first question (or statement?) was: dogs are not allowed on the terrace. Aren't they?  We were confused and after 2 hours in the car without lunch we had to settle this issue once again with management and once again we received a positive answer. Then nobody could tell us where we can order the lunch from the menu on website and finally we were waiting about an hour for  chiken wrap sandwich (16 euro) that finally was so strange like it was made by the waiter in a hurry and we were not sure it has been made of chicken not pork. So we had to literally escape from this paradise because nobody can tell us what's going on. It seemed there were no managers in the hotel. Low season and unprofessional staff. This hotel spoiled our vacation. Also I'd like to mention that rooms are shabby and you should be ready that during the day they have groups of tourists in the hotel because it's a museum....

The hotel is very nice and the two parlor rooms near the restaurants are beautiful. The front desk associates were extremely polite and helpful. cons: The bedroom contained twin beds although we requested a double/full bed. It's difficult to comprehend why they have twin beds in the first place because the room was not small. The room was cold and not very inviting or even comfortable. Our balcony door opened up on to a porch and rooftop garden that you couldn't walk out onto because everything was so overgrown and unkept. Definitely Not worth the extra cost.

We also ordered the vegetarian pasta from the main menu and literally received five pieces of ravioli. After complaining they did offer a substitute but we declined however still charged full price for the meal. The lamb was clearly microwaved and overpriced and tasted off. For the price you would expect more. Also the first two days there was a wedding the place was completely overrun and couldn’t order a drink at the bar. Staff could smile a bit more and you had to basically beg for coffee in the morning. Did send message to complain via booking but did not receive a response the spa/gym is not a spa/gym either.

Lunch menu was exactly the same as evening menu unless you ate off the swimming pool snack menu which was very expensive.  We did try 2 x chicken wraps from this menu at 14 euro each and I complained that there was virtually no chicken it just the top you could see so 28 euro for 2 lettuce wraps is excessive.  The waitress said she would tell the chef but we got no response.  In regard to the evening menu which we tried at least 3 times this was very mixed sometimes good and reasonable value for a cheese platter (18 euro for sharing) cod loin and tagliatelle also good but slightly expensive.  The other problem item was 6 pieces of ravioli for 17 euro albiet they may have been freshly made but lacked flavour and at that price were nothing like a meal. The other item to mention which is also confusing is the lack of tea/coffee making facility in a luxury hotel and when I mentioned this to receptiion they said they don't do it.  I had a short email survey the following day mentioned the lack of a kettle etc and low and behold said items appeared!  If this survey does reach the management I would very much like to be refunded for the Chicken Wraps as I feel that I was deceived with the way they were presented and never received an apology. cons: See above

Most of them didn’t know what they were doing. looks like they came directly from the street without any experience. 
we couldn’t get beers for 2 days only non alcoholic drinks and cocktails were available. This is very bad for a supposingly 5 star hotel.
Bad management on the whole. In the restaurant for dinner we had to wait for 1/2 hour before someone took our orders and it took a very long time before our food arrived. 
we had dinner 2 nights in a row and it was the same. 
on the whole I should say that the Pousada is badly managed. it is pity really since the palacio is such a fantastic place. 
There was a large group of Americans there too and there is no excuse at all for the bad service. They hotel must have known this a long way ahead and yet????
we have stay at this Pousada I think this was our third time and this was the worst experience we had so far.
No proper bar tender. who ever who was working at the bar couldn’t even make or serve a simple Martini as it should be . shame shame!!!!
For breakfast it was the same thing. the serving plates on the buffet table were mostly empty most of the time.

The staff were attentive and friendly. The views are incredible and the ancient grounds and walled garden are lovely to explore. cons: I did not appreciate that Booking.com promotes it as a 5-star hotel. It may have been exceptional 30 years ago when the new addition was added but since then it has deteriorated significantly and needs updating and repair.  Tired and stained carpets and overall cleanliness are not up to snuff. It is also important to understand that the bedrooms are not in the 17th-century palace but in a 30-year-old modern annex down the side. The web site is misleading.

It is just a cynical ruse to minimise kitchen costs whilst charging  pie-in-the-sky high prices. An average dinner starter + main + dessert will cost a couple around the price of the room (130 Euros) The fancy menu is carefully contrived to minimise the chef’s preparation time of the meagre portions they serve. If you are hungry for a proper dinner there are no alternative restaurants in Estoi to provide any competition.  The advice is ‘check out online UberEats in the Faro area before you make your reservation’. There are excellent alternative restaurants nearby who will deliver a substantial Algarvean prata do dia to your hotel room at a sensible price.

You fall down the gap as a single (and no doubt as a couple).   

The hotel seems understaffed for a ""5-star"" property.   I had heavy bags and no one offered help or helped get the bags to my room - which was a long long way from reception.     

I called to change room but no one answered as soon as I saw it was a twin room - so finally had to walk back to reception to try to change it as no one was answering after 5-10 minutes.     Reception said there was only 1 room left and it was another twin.   (There appeared to be more than 7 rooms showing as available on Booking.com).      I was going to move hotels as I hate twin beds - but it was getting late etc.  

The restaurant was to close at 10:30 pm - so I got there at 9:45 pm and was greeted by the host with a bit of attitude/lack of enthusiasm.   Very much felt it was an inconvenience for them.   Again not great for a ""5-star"" property.    But the dinner was nice so all good in the end.   

Another couple I met at the restaurant that checked in just before me got a king-size bed- and had somehow double booked so their second room so explained that should be available as well.   I went to check with reception and again no other rooms were available.    It just seemed strange that 7 rooms were showing as available but reception said only 1 and that was a twin.      Maybe that was the case so all good.

The room and hotel overall - just a little tired in places - bath wouldn't drain properly.  Grim around the toilet flush button.  Pool spa wouldn't work."

Lovely garden and great pool. 
Beds comfortable and good shower cons: This has the small luxury hotel badge and having stayed at others this does not quite meet the standards. The breakfast was not good. Eggs were just very milky fluff and Algarve being where oranges literally come from - the juices were not fresh / natural. at the very least you expect natural orange juice from the region that grows oranges! 
The door closest to cars was locked which means you have to lug your wheelie luggage through an entrance that has couple of steps which is inefficient. For an SLH hotel quite a few improvements are required. the bathroom although very powerful are a bit dated. The sheets were cold no extra blanket. 
You are obliged to have your clothes pressed at a price because irons are not allowed (apparently illegal due to fire risk) 
The staff were very friendly and always super helpful so could not fault the service experience from Reception to Restaurant and cleaning staff - all lovely and helpful team. 
However the facilities really need a revamp. Therefore the value for money was completely unjustified"

The pool area is nice albeit a bit small perhaps. cons: It needs some TLC. ripped towels. Filthy curtains with holes. The gardens were severely overgrown. Only two of the staff ever smiled - everyone seemed miserable. Getting a taxi was always a pain. It just wasn’t anything we had hoped.

Eusebio the receptionist is super friendly and stands out. cons: everything is a bit dark used (holes in the curtains stains on the carpets) not cleaned well (hairs in the bathroom clogged shower—both from the first day on no attention to details personal is max average. the clogged shower however was fixed the day after we mentioned it to Eusebio."

Nice experience for a stopover. Pool was gorgeous and sauna area nice too. cons: Two main things: beds and food. Worst beds ever! So unbelievably uncomfortable. Food was expensive and terrible. We dined one night in the restaurant and it was awful even though the staff were lovely. Estoi is also a ghost town so no options for good food there either. Fine for one night stay but no more than that.

On the terrace the bushes that face the terrace coulfpd use a trimming as it obstructed the wonderful view.
The staff were very polite but could use more training to offer help and dining services to bring things up to world class status.
We know that staffing is difficult in Portugal but quality of service should be strived for to have guests return. cons: Staffing and quality of service is a big one.
In the pool area knowledge of drinks and availability of items lacking.  For a world class hotel you would think that there would also be service to guests sitting about on the deck to enhance there experience.
The gardens - main and outside rooms was in need of attention as well as windows that were very dirty.  You open the curtains to see the view and get dirty windows.
We loved Estoi - the Palace and appreciate how the new addition was blended into the landscape with natural plantings on the roofs.  Great idea for entities and cooling nature for the buildings.
The lack of a concierge was a problem in that we needed to ask for options for dining and other tourist info and it was not available.
To truly rate yourself as a world class hotel we feel that these items should be addressed."

Had I known the unforeseen circumstances was actually a wedding taking place at the venue on the same weekend I would have declined the offer immediately. 
Perhaps this is a great venue for weddings! As an hotel guest I felt neglected and unwelcome."

All appetizers were served cold – including pastel of baccalau - and appeared to be the kind that one could find at any grocery store.  There were 3 main courses in steam dishes but none of the food was better than a bit more than lukewarm.  None were hot.  The first was all vegetables – broccoli so old that it had turned yellow on the tips before cooking - and  all were overcooked.  The second was mostly overcooked vegetables with some octopus.  Third was pork cubes with some potatoes with absolutely no distinguishing taste.  Dessert was no better than I would expect to get in a second rate bakery in the US.
I strongly suggest that anypne staying here on a Saturday night skip the buffet and eat at any one of several restaurants in Estoi.

The common areas are lovely.  The room is fine except that the only electric plugs are one inconveniently located under the desk where it an only be reached on hands and knees and the second more than 2 meters from the bed at floor level."

Good garage. cons: The beds are rock hard.
We lived on floor 0 felt like living underground.
The garden in front of the room's terrace poorly maintained garden area. Well-being would be significantly increased if a view was created from the room's terrace.
The roads to the hotel are extremely small and it is almost impossible to get there with a larger car.
The first thing you see when you enter the reception. is a garbage station to the hotel (with gates that could be closed so you could not see it but they were open both when we came and went)"

Staff very friendly especially on reception. cons: These comments are made with constructive criticism in mind - we are not angry but just felt the hotel could do so so much better for some little effort and some attention to detail. We were disappointed that the same menu all week and food not quite top notch. No special options each day. No different lunch menu offered - tapas or bruschetta or local delicacies would be nice but just the lacklustre evening menu repeated. Poolside bar not open at all and nobody on tap asking if we would like a drink. A completely non-functional bar area with absolutely nowhere to site and nobody manning it (use one of the amazing rooms why not?). Detritus not removed around pool all day. Wardrobe doors in rooms slam so noisily. Blocked off routes and locked gates around property not allowing you to have a really nice wander around. Rooms not made up at all when we put signs on doors for speedy service.

As salas  antigas proporcionam uma experiência que nos remete para o passado palaciano e luxuoso e convivem em plena harmonia com todas as comodidades e modernidade da ala dos quartos. Quarto muito amplo camas grandes e muito confortáveis. Terraço do quarto muito agradável. Pequeno almoço rico com produtos frescos e variados. Pessoal maioritariamente atencioso e eficiente. Facilidade de estacionamento no exterior (embora havendo parque coberto não necessitamos usar). Jardim cuidado e esplanada do restaurante muito agradável para tomar o pequeno-almoço uma bebida. Experiência global excecional e diferente do Algarve de massas e incaracterístico. cons: A parte mais interessante (e maior) do Jardim é pertença da Câmara Municipal e o acesso faz-se por uma ruela mal assinalada no centro da vila e de muito difícil acesso que torna quase impossível a visita com idosos ou pessoas de mobilidade reduzida (mas tal não é de responsabilidade da Pousada mas antes da autarquia)

Está en un sitio al que hay que ir específicamente al hotel porque no tiene próximo sitios de interés. De igual forma merece la pena. Las zonas comunes son las que componen el palacio y las estancias mas ""versallescas"". Las habitaciones están en un edificio paralelo y son de nueva construcción. La entrada al hotel se hace a través de lo que fue la capilla.  Adicional en los jardines hay columnas romanas y dos edificios con unas cristaleras de colores que son preciosos. El personal ha sido muy agradable y todos los servicios buenos. cons: Nos dio pena que no estuvieran accesibles todas las zonas del jardín porque están en proceso de restauración. Habría sido espectacular poder ver el hotel al completo con todos los jardines. Tendremos que volver más adelante cuando esté completamente abierto al público.
Adicionalmente creo que el acceso al hotel se debería plantear por el pequeño museo y no por la capilla. Podrían aprovechar la capilla y darle algún uso. Al acceder por la capilla tienes que pasar por un estrecho pasillo lateral con las maletas y es un poco incómodo pero bueno es parte de la experiencia del hotel."

Gostei da simpatia dos funcionários da receção com destaque para o Sr. Eusébio que nos fez sentir muito bem vindos. O pequeno almoço era adequado e completo. O quarto era bastante espaçoso e relativamente confortável. Gostei muito que tivessem arranjado um quarto com cama de casal conforme solicitado. A piscina era de tamanho adequado para o tamanho do hotel e bem localizada. Os jardins são muito bonitos bem cuidados. cons: Infelizmente existem alguns pontos a serem melhorados e vou ser um pouco mais extenso pois estamos a falar de um hotel de 5 estrelas pertencente ao Small Luxury Hotels of the World em que se espera nada mais do que excelência.
Um que salta logo à vista e que pessoalmente me incomoda bastante é o estado da limpeza/apresentação dos elevadores. Chegamos a um hotel muito bonito e assim que nos deslocamos para o quarto somos presenteados com um elevador muito pouco cuidado o que não ajuda em nada a experiência. Também as montras do piso 3 onde estão expostas peças com alguma relevância do hotel se nota que a limpeza não foi a mais correta sendo visível o vidro baço e com marcas do pano. Este desleixo estende-se à televisão de uma das salas nobres que toda a nossa estadia esteve sempre com marcas de sujidade e gordura. No dia anterior houve um evento e na manhã ainda eram visíveis vestígios tais como alguns copos e afins na zona do jardim.
O estado da limpeza da zona da piscina interior banho turco sauna e duche também não era das melhores notando-se algum desleixo nomeadamente nas marcas amareladas na parede da piscina ao nível da água. Agora o pior e que quero acreditar que foi um caso único foi a presença de baratas nesta zona da piscina interior. Ao estarmos a relaxar na piscina interior com os jactos de água a funcionar e uma família que também lá estava verificou a existência de duas baratas dentro de água o que levou a que saíssemos todos da piscina. De seguida fomos para o banho turco e aconteceu o mesmo. Esta situação foi imediatamente reportada a um dos responsáveis que nos justificou com uma desbaratização exterior.
Para concluir penso que seria mais simpático os funcionários receberem os hospedes no pequeno almoço com um ""Bom dia"" em vez de partirem do principio que somos todos estrangeiros e recebermos um ""Good Morning""."

A sobremesa não fazia grande sentido na nossa opinião uma vez que o gelado de menta anula o bolo de laranja.
O bolo de laranja resultaria bem com o mel que no entanto quase  não estava presente.
