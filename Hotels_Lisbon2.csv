The room was pristine large and had very thoughtful details throughout during the stay (including some delicious local treats). Fab breakfast with a great variety of sweet/savoury baked goods eggs hot/cold meats fresh seasonal fruit and natural yoghurt. Location is perfect for a short or long stay. I stayed here upon recommendation from my parents & friends who have stayed here over the years and my stay (altho short due to being delayed arriving) exceeded expectations. This was my first time in Portugal and I am really looking forward to returning! cons: Nothing!

My son came down with a stomach virus and hotel staff were so kind and helpful with preparing special food for him finding us a Dr who did housecalls and even scouring pharmacies to find us the medicine the Dr had prescribed. The breakfast was amazing and included smoked salmon and mimosas every day!  Also eggs bread cheese charcuterie fresh fruit/veggiesetc.  Can't understand why anyone would complain about this.  Hotel is central to almost everything and walkable.  Room was decent size and clean. cons: The bathroom had a slight sewage smell even though hotel tried to fix it. This is common in Lisbon especially in older buildings in the Baixa and wouldn't stop me from booking here again.  Hotel is located near the Mouraria neighborhood which can be dodgy at night but again no biggie for me.  I felt the subway but only barely  - didn't prevent me from sleeping like a baby during my stay.  Bring earplugs if you're sensitive to noise.  The amazing staff and comfy beds make up for these small issues

Portugal Boutique Hotel,en-us,2024-09-12,2024-09-14,couple,leisure,us,4,2,2024-09-24 15:32:15,pros: The Portugal Boutique Hotel is one of my favorite hotels. The staff were friendly and accommodating and went out of the way to make us feel welcome. Each night we had a tray of treats waiting for us.  One night they provided a small bottle of Ginjinha the most iconic drink of Lisbon dating back to the 13th century. On our last evening we had a lovely personalized note thanking us for our stay. The room was spacious and quiet - the wonderful shutters helped to keep it quiet and dark (we actually overslept the first morning it was so comfortable). The bathroom was outstanding with both a shower and a bathtub. Breakfast was superb with many choices (and oh that fabulous orange juice) which you could enjoy either inside or outside on their terrace (which we did). I could not have asked for a better location. It was within walking distance of all that we wanted to see. If we ever find ourselves in Lisbon again we will absolutely stay here again Thank you for a wonderful few days and nights! cons: The only thing that could have been better is that we had been able to stay an additional night or two! I can't think of a single thing that needed improvement! Wonderful hotel.

Portugal Boutique Hotel,en-gb,2024-08-24,2024-08-29,couple,leisure,gb,4,5,2024-09-16 10:55:03,"pros: For my wife and I the best experience was Hotel during our visit and most definitely one of the best hotels we have stayed in. All staff members were excellent but 3 stood out to us the most:

Carlos works as a manager for the breakfast service and was incredible. He would always greet us well and go the extra mile to make sure we were well looked after. He made us feel like family and each time we saw him it was a delight to interact and learn about the Portuguese culture. 

In addition we were doing a trip to Sintra where we saw one of the breakfast team staff members on the train (I wish we had taken his name for this review). They could have easily ignored us but it was clear the level of respect they had for themselves and their job that they smiled and greeted us on the train when they didn't have to. 

João the Hotel Manager was great too. The hotel offer a view of their wine cellar and you can try their hotel made wines too. We was under the impression that the experience would be around 30-45 mins long but my wife and I had such a great experience with João and with his teachings of Portuguese wines and culture that we was there for over 2 hours. It was a great experience and with creating this great relationship with João João and the team would always go the extra mile to come talk and just share great learnings with us. 

We appreciate that for some people a Hotel may just be a place of sleep but in honesty the experience here was more than that for us. Everyone was truly great and just being able to interact with the staff on a more personal level you do really get to experience more than just place to sleep. 

Great Hotel great team and great experience (also in a great location too). cons: "

The breakfast spread was simple but delicious and plentiful and the staff very accommodating.
The hotel's location was excellent and as out room faced the interior courtyard was very quiet.
Access to the sister hotel's rooftop bar was a bonus as it has excellent views of Lisbon and the amazing sunsets.
The best thing about the hotel was the staff. The hotel manager made our group feel very special by inviting us to a private wine tasting. The reception staff were very knowledgeable about the city. One example staff of going above and beyond was when we advised them of our very early departure they had breakfast packs ready for our party of eight and also switched on the coffee machine early to offer us coffees before we left. cons: "

Staff were excellent - very patient and articulate. Special mention for Alexandra Joao Anonessa Mariana and the Brazilian guy in the ground floor Bar - they always seemed to go the extra mile to make you comfortable.
There is a welcome drink on arrival a Ginjinha drink on the first evening and another Port drink on the last evening before departure - all complimentary! Breakfast was good. Taxi from the airport took €20 - and the driver insisted on cash - so you may want to keep some cash with you or else there’s also a cash machine nearby. 
Went to the rooftop bar on the last evening- it had good vibes and a very good view of the Castle specially during dusk and when the lights came on. cons: No negative feedback that I can think of."

The staff was super friendly and helpful. We had the fortune to be upgraded to a suite on the top floor which was huge - a big room and a separate living area. The room was clean and well furnished. cons: It is hard to find faults when we had such good treatment. One comment I can make is the observation that the breakfast area is very small (some people had to wait to be seated) and is not a buffet style one had to order items separately and the options were basic not much variety when compared to other hotels in a similar category. This is not something the actually detracted from our experience."

Breakfast was great but you order from a menu taking a little more time than a buffet. cons: As of February 2024 the thermostats only turned on for heat. In an unusually warm winter we needed to cool the room which was at 75 degrees Fahrenheit. We had to open the windows to cool the room which could not be left open over night because of the street noise. I got the impression it was a ""winter"" thing but I would double check before booking again."

As a Canadian I appreciated the real maple syrup! Breakfast room is a bit small but far nicer than the average breakfast buffet room you usually see in hotels. cons: TV was a bit weird (behind the mirror) also small by today's standards for such a large room. But I did love the array of media inputs for the TV to support devices. I marked the facilities down one step as the carpets need replacing. Still many steps above some other hotels though.

Large supermarket on the same block too. 
Breakfast was very good good choice & staff extremely helpful. Everything is served to your table. Breakfast very busy at peak time but no different to other hotels at peak time.
Reception staff extremely helpful too & they remembered my special request made at booking months before so they’d obviously checked our booking. 
Very clean & comfortable & with a lovely boutique vibe inside. Wooden interior shutters help to block out the light & add to soundproofing from the double glazing. 
Liked the TV incorporated into the giant mirror in the room. 
The staff delivered a welcome gift & a leaving gift to our room. Lovely local food & drinks. Such a nice touch! cons: Difficult to think as everything was so good!
We would have liked a kettle for hot drinks in our room but think this must only be available in more expensive rooms or suites. 
I also requested sensitive skin bedding/towels due to allergies but the hotel laundry didn’t appear to have any suitable detergents. The staff did remember though & told me at check in that they had requested non fragranced detergents. 
Some hotels now use all anti allergy detergents due to the increasing number of people with similar allergies."

The hotel is located in the heart of Lisbon just a short walk from Rossio Square the São Jorge Castle and the Tagus River.
 The rooms are all individually decorated and spacious with some even having balconies with city views. The bathrooms are also very spacious and come with bathtubs and showers.
The staff at the Portugal Boutique Hotel are some of the friendliest and most helpful I've encountered. They are always willing to go the extra mile to make your stay enjoyable.
The breakfast is served in a bright and airy room and includes a variety of Portuguese and international dishes. There is also a good selection of coffee and tea.

The only thing a bit “interesting” was that you needed to order what you wanted that is ok due to costs savings but it was a bit difficult to order one glass of water and another one and so on same with the orange juice. In others words it took some time to have another glass of water when it was full. I would suggest to leave the opportunity for the guests to take there on water or juice."

The hotel is beautifully appointed and the staff was exceptionally accommodating at every point of service. Attentive without being intrusive. The room was quiet very comfortable with large bath temperature/light control comfy bed/linens Delta espresso machine and mini refrigerator. The TV is in the large room mirror- special touch. Breakfast was excellent and served at our reserved table. We felt warmly welcomed and cared for throughout our stay. Reception was always available to provide for example restaurant/Fado recommendations or patient assistance with map navigation and transportation options. A note of welcome with a personal bottle of Port and 'thank you for staying' gift of a Portuguese bottle of liquor on the evening before our departure- examples of that extra touch of hospitality that separates a 4-star from a 5-star hotel.

Portugal Boutique Hotel,en-us,2023-03-15,2023-03-22,couple,leisure,us,4,7,2023-03-27 05:14:40,"pros: First the staff is exceptional.  From the time we checked in until the time we left we were treated like royalty.  I have never had a hotel experience like this one and it will be hard to find another.  I was celebrating my 65th birthday and was treated with a bottle of champagne chocolates coconut cookie bites and a bottle of port wine.  Over the top.  The front desk staff made it a point to get to know their guests.  They were always friendly and ensured all our needs were met.  The same can be said of the breakfast staff.  Each morning we were greeted cheerfully by the hostess and again she made sure we were getting everything we needed or would go the extra mile to meet those needs. She even remembered our breakfast choices from previous days. We looked forward to the delicious breakfast and service in the dining room each morning. Great way to start our daily activities.  Upon leaving the front desk booked our transfer and ensured our safe departure.

The hotel is modern and clean.  The fragrance they use in the common areas is calming and spa-like.  The attention to details adds so much quality to this boutique hotel.  

The location of the hotel is perfect.  Out the door and around the corner to catch Tram 38 or within walking distance of so much of central Lisbon. Restaurants shopping museums everything is close by.

The experience at this hotel has set the bar for my future travels.  Again we are most appreciative of the staff and the care we received. cons: The only thing we had issue with at the hotel was the tub/shower combo.  It was quite high and a challenge for us to get in and out of safely.  There is a grab bar and we just had to be cautious not to slip or fall on our way in/out.  Also there is a door stop in front of the toilet that kept the door from hitting the toilet.  We tripped on this stop several times when the door was closed.  It is in an awkward place - but can't see how it could be remedied."

It is very well run breakfast was conducted a-la-carte while we were there that did mean you had to book a timeslot the previous day.Nice little touch they sent half a bottle of Port and 2 pasteis  de Nata to our room on the day of check in. We also got a free upgrade to our room which made our stay even better. Smiley doorman and lovely staff all round cons: Did not do my research properly and did discover on the day that this hotel is in fact on top of the underground. It did not bother us to be honest and it kind of became 'white noise' so not necessarily a negative from my point of view. But if you are a light/ jumpy sleeper needing perfect quiet you may have to reconsider if this is the right hotel for you. All in all an amazing stay.

Portugal Boutique Hotel,en-gb,2023-02-25,2023-02-26,couple,leisure,it,4,1,2023-02-27 12:03:49,pros: The hotel is located in the Lisboa downtown in a pedestrian area so it is very quite. From there you can easily reach every spot by foot. The room is very comfy and big everything was perfect in the right way. The bathroom is very big and some glass doors allow you to share the toilet in privacy. The breakfast was very good with a  big choice of different food and drinks. The staff was super they also offered us very special sweets and drinks of Lisboa as a room service. Btw even I was born in Italy I tasted one of the best espresso ever tried abroad by a room coffee machine. The mirrored TV screen is something very impressive.

We walked everywhere from the hotel and also very easily got Ubers when needed. The hotel and restaurant staff were very friendly and accommodating. Very comfortable bed. The included breakfast was good and as expected. cons: The only “complaints” to share are that the rooms are heavily sprayed with perfume which I didn’t love breathing in. Also we could only control the hot temperature in the room not the cool AC and we were hot at night. This may have been due to the time of year that the AC was deactivated? Overall really enjoyable stay.

My wife and I stayed at the Portugal Boutique Hotel for three nights as a 60th birthday present for my wife.
We stayed in a large beautiful room which was spotlessly clean.
On arrival we were left little custard tarts and a small bottle of port in our room. 
On our second night when we arrived back at our room we had a fantastic surprise when the hotel management had left us a bottle of sparkling wine in an ice bucket and chocolates with a beautiful hand written note wishing my wife a happy birthday. 
I cannot rate the staff highly enough so helpful and courteous from receptionist too the breakfast room staff.
They had a nice selection of food which was served to you at your table even sparkling wine. The staff always had a smile for us in the morning. 
Once again thank you Portugal boutique hotel for a beautiful and relaxing stay We look forward to returning and would recommend this hotel  to anyone.

My son came down with a stomach virus and hotel staff were so kind and helpful with preparing special food for him finding us a Dr who did housecalls and even scouring pharmacies to find us the medicine the Dr had prescribed.

Hotel is central to almost everything and walkable.  Room was decent size and clean. cons: The bathroom had a slight sewage smell even though hotel tried to fix it. This is common in Lisbon especially in older buildings in the Baixa and wouldn't stop me from booking here again.  Hotel is located near the Mouraria neighborhood which can be dodgy at night but again no biggie for me.  I felt the subway but only barely  - didn't prevent me from sleeping like a baby during my stay.  Bring earplugs if you're sensitive to noise.

The staff were friendly and accommodating and went out of the way to make us feel welcome. Each night we had a tray of treats waiting for us.  One night they provided a small bottle of Ginjinha the most iconic drink of Lisbon dating back to the 13th century. On our last evening we had a lovely personalized note thanking us for our stay. The room was spacious and quiet - the wonderful shutters helped to keep it quiet and dark (we actually overslept the first morning it was so comfortable). The bathroom was outstanding with both a shower and a bathtub. Breakfast was superb with many choices (and oh that fabulous orange juice) which you could enjoy either inside or outside on their terrace (which we did). I could not have asked for a better location. It was within walking distance of all that we wanted to see. If we ever find ourselves in Lisbon again we will absolutely stay here again Thank you for a wonderful few days and nights! cons: The only thing that could have been better is that we had been able to stay an additional night or two! I can't think of a single thing that needed improvement! Wonderful hotel.

Portugal Boutique Hotel,en-gb,2024-08-24,2024-08-29,couple,leisure,gb,4,5,2024-09-16 10:55:03,"pros: For my wife and I the best experience was Hotel during our visit and most definitely one of the best hotels we have stayed in. All staff members were excellent but 3 stood out to us the most:

Carlos works as a manager for the breakfast service and was incredible. He would always greet us well and go the extra mile to make sure we were well looked after. He made us feel like family and each time we saw him it was a delight to interact and learn about the Portuguese culture. 

In addition we were doing a trip to Sintra where we saw one of the breakfast team staff members on the train (I wish we had taken his name for this review). They could have easily ignored us but it was clear the level of respect they had for themselves and their job that they smiled and greeted us on the train when they didn't have to. 

João the Hotel Manager was great too. The hotel offer a view of their wine cellar and you can try their hotel made wines too. We was under the impression that the experience would be around 30-45 mins long but my wife and I had such a great experience with João and with his teachings of Portuguese wines and culture that we was there for over 2 hours. It was a great experience and with creating this great relationship with João João and the team would always go the extra mile to come talk and just share great learnings with us. 

We appreciate that for some people a Hotel may just be a place of sleep but in honesty the experience here was more than that for us. Everyone was truly great and just being able to interact with the staff on a more personal level you do really get to experience more than just place to sleep. 

Great Hotel great team and great experience (also in a great location too). cons: "

The breakfast spread was simple but delicious and plentiful and the staff very accommodating.
The hotel's location was excellent and as out room faced the interior courtyard was very quiet.
Access to the sister hotel's rooftop bar was a bonus as it has excellent views of Lisbon and the amazing sunsets.
The best thing about the hotel was the staff. The hotel manager made our group feel very special by inviting us to a private wine tasting. The reception staff were very knowledgeable about the city. One example staff of going above and beyond was when we advised them of our very early departure they had breakfast packs ready for our party of eight and also switched on the coffee machine early to offer us coffees before we left. cons: "

Staff were excellent - very patient and articulate. Special mention for Alexandra Joao Anonessa Mariana and the Brazilian guy in the ground floor Bar - they always seemed to go the extra mile to make you comfortable.
There is a welcome drink on arrival a Ginjinha drink on the first evening and another Port drink on the last evening before departure - all complimentary! Breakfast was good. Taxi from the airport took €20 - and the driver insisted on cash - so you may want to keep some cash with you or else there’s also a cash machine nearby. 
Went to the rooftop bar on the last evening- it had good vibes and a very good view of the Castle specially during dusk and when the lights came on. cons: No negative feedback that I can think of."

Reception staff extremely helpful too & they remembered my special request made at booking months before so they’d obviously checked our booking. 
Very clean & comfortable & with a lovely boutique vibe inside. Wooden interior shutters help to block out the light & add to soundproofing from the double glazing. 
Liked the TV incorporated into the giant mirror in the room. 
The staff delivered a welcome gift & a leaving gift to our room. Lovely local food & drinks. Such a nice touch! cons: Difficult to think as everything was so good!
We would have liked a kettle for hot drinks in our room but think this must only be available in more expensive rooms or suites. 
I also requested sensitive skin bedding/towels due to allergies but the hotel laundry didn’t appear to have any suitable detergents. The staff did remember though & told me at check in that they had requested non fragranced detergents. 
Some hotels now use all anti allergy detergents due to the increasing number of people with similar allergies."

The hotel was located in the old town centre close to the main shopping areas with many restaurant nearby and perfectly situated for exploring. It was less than a 30 minute taxi ride from the airport (€20). Trams and buses are only short walk away. We had a great time staying here.

It was my wife’s birthday whilst we were there and they made a real effort to make it memorable and enjoyable. We had a great time. cons: There was nothing that we didn’t like about this hotel.

Portugal Boutique Hotel,en-us,2023-03-15,2023-03-22,couple,leisure,us,4,7,2023-03-27 05:14:40,"pros: First the staff is exceptional.  From the time we checked in until the time we left we were treated like royalty.  I have never had a hotel experience like this one and it will be hard to find another.  I was celebrating my 65th birthday and was treated with a bottle of champagne chocolates coconut cookie bites and a bottle of port wine.  Over the top.  The front desk staff made it a point to get to know their guests.  They were always friendly and ensured all our needs were met.  The same can be said of the breakfast staff.  Each morning we were greeted cheerfully by the hostess and again she made sure we were getting everything we needed or would go the extra mile to meet those needs. She even remembered our breakfast choices from previous days. We looked forward to the delicious breakfast and service in the dining room each morning. Great way to start our daily activities.  Upon leaving the front desk booked our transfer and ensured our safe departure.

The hotel is modern and clean.  The fragrance they use in the common areas is calming and spa-like.  The attention to details adds so much quality to this boutique hotel.  

The location of the hotel is perfect.  Out the door and around the corner to catch Tram 38 or within walking distance of so much of central Lisbon. Restaurants shopping museums everything is close by.

The experience at this hotel has set the bar for my future travels.  Again we are most appreciative of the staff and the care we received. cons: The only thing we had issue with at the hotel was the tub/shower combo.  It was quite high and a challenge for us to get in and out of safely.  There is a grab bar and we just had to be cautious not to slip or fall on our way in/out.  Also there is a door stop in front of the toilet that kept the door from hitting the toilet.  We tripped on this stop several times when the door was closed.  It is in an awkward place - but can't see how it could be remedied."

It is very well run breakfast was conducted a-la-carte while we were there that did mean you had to book a timeslot the previous day.Nice little touch they sent half a bottle of Port and 2 pasteis  de Nata to our room on the day of check in. We also got a free upgrade to our room which made our stay even better. Smiley doorman and lovely staff all round cons: Did not do my research properly and did discover on the day that this hotel is in fact on top of the underground. It did not bother us to be honest and it kind of became 'white noise' so not necessarily a negative from my point of view. But if you are a light/ jumpy sleeper needing perfect quiet you may have to reconsider if this is the right hotel for you. All in all an amazing stay.

Also we could only control the hot temperature in the room not the cool AC and we were hot at night. This may have been due to the time of year that the AC was deactivated?

My wife and I stayed at the Portugal Boutique Hotel for three nights as a 60th birthday present for my wife.
We stayed in a large beautiful room which was spotlessly clean.
On arrival we were left little custard tarts and a small bottle of port in our room. 
On our second night when we arrived back at our room we had a fantastic surprise when the hotel management had left us a bottle of sparkling wine in an ice bucket and chocolates with a beautiful hand written note wishing my wife a happy birthday. 
I cannot rate the staff highly enough so helpful and courteous from receptionist too the breakfast room staff.
They had a nice selection of food which was served to you at your table even sparkling wine. The staff always had a smile for us in the morning.

We stayed in two different rooms on either end of our trip. I would definitely recommend upgrading to the larger room. The restaurant and breakfast was fabulous as was dinner.

The breakfast is excellent and the restaurant is also.  The front desk among the best anywhere.  The location could not be better.

I am a plant and flower lover and having my breakfast in within palm trees 🌳 felt amazing. The staff at reception were very kind and helpful with advice and the restaurant service was always caring and welcoming 🫶🏼 I felt really well taken  care off and will definitely come back another time. cons: The rooms were a bit small and the air conditioning stopped working in the middle of August - so the room felt a big hot at times. I also feel the bathroom could do with an update for design and small details like tissue box and sink/ soaps and sliding door kept shutting without me touching it. It would have also been good to have the coffee Maschine explained better and story of the Delta brand behind for it being a traditional Portuguese brand and totally recyclable ♻️

The pool/outside area is just absolutely stunning with all of the plants and we were able to relax out there for a little while and thoroughly enjoyed it. The location of the hotel was also in great proximity to things. We would have loved to have had more time to explore Lisbon and more nights here but would definitely recommend it and/or stay again if we visit Lisbon again!

The location was so so good. Close to the city centre with everything we needed within walking distance. The hotel itself has a lot of character. We had a lovely room on the 1st floor with a little terrace area. The staff are some of the best I have come across. They couldn’t do enough for you. 
It was so nice to have the use of a pool which provided a lovely spot to relax after long days walking around.

The buffet offers fruit yoghurt bread cheese and water and juice options. Coffee is to be ordered. The staff are taking their time to get everything prepared despite the restaurant (and the hotel in general) not being super big. One day we only had 25 minutes for breakfast due to a morning trip we had booked and the restaurant team couldn't organise themselves to take our (simple) order and prepare it in time not even our coffee! I don't see this as a business hotel despite the central location. More for tourists with plenty of time. Also in June there are lots of local celebrations in Lisbon including temporary street food areas on some of the squares. One such area nearby would play live music until midnight and the sound somehow gets amplified by the buildings around to the extent that you have a live concert in your hotel room unless you close all windows. With closed windows - you would still hear it but not that bad.

PS Room 102 and 104 have the bigger terraces. We stayed in 103 - private terrace is highly recommended - a small oasis above the central oasis of the hotel cons: We could have used a big chair in the room - to read and relax.

Tons of nice restaurants around and the main shopping street is a stone trow away.

The hotel design is beautiful especially the dense tropical garden outside 😍

And the value for money was great!! cons: 1. Temperature setting in the room was impossible to understand and to set right. After 15 min of trying to set it up to colder temperature we had to give it and switch it off completely - as the result the room was super hot during the night. Be smarter than us check it out with somebody before it’s 2am at night..

2. The restaurant team needs a bit more training. Eveybody is super nice and helpful but one guy literally put his finger into my egg bowl when serving and another person served a sandwich in the restaurant with no cuttlery or even napkin."

Also no vanity kits in the bathroom which one relies on when travelling.

Shortly after we got in our room there was a knock on the door with some welcome pastries and hand written welcome card. On my wifes birthday (which we didnt announce) they brought in champaigne cake pastries and hand written birthday card. When we asked in Whatsapp for two fresh towels they brought those within 1 minute. The hotel was wonderful the location was very close to city center the breakfast was delicious and the staff was out of this world.

It has a rare combination of very a attractive product incredibly friendly and attentive staff and a great location.
The hotel opened up only in 2021 so the hardware is still brand new. The breakfast was very very good and a bit more original as most breakfast we have had in Portugal during our holidays. We had lunch once in the restaurant next to the pool which was also high quality. One of the things we liked most about the hotel was the tropical garden with the pool the sundeck and the terrace. Ideal if you don’t feel like getting around town and just want some time off. It is done very tastefully and not something you would expect in a citycentre hotel. And again a big praise for the staff; nothing was too much - both in the reception and in the restaurant. Always cheerful and nothing was too much. A special praise to Bruno - he is a jewel for this place. The rooms are comfortable (but small !) with a good bed good airco good wifi and good shower. Also very good that there were no single use plastics in the rooms or elsewhere in the hotel. Next time in Lissabon we will for sure stay here again.
Also very convenient that there is a large public car park just around the corner. cons: Just a few notes and some suggestions; I missed a gym. There is a tattoo studio and a yoga studio but I am pretty sure most guest would value a good gym better. The the safes in the room are small; a normal laptop does not fit. And then something which is more of a fact; the rooms are small ( I guess around 18m2) and the price is high ( we paid around € 350- per night ). I can understand the price because of the facilities location and the great staff but for these rates you would expect a bit more generous rooms."

the staff were exceptional all super friendly really good at their jobs and very helpful.
I had the basic small double which was very nice with a couple of caveats.
breakfast was lovely a continental buffet and a choice of hot options all very tasty. cons: a few things in the room felt a bit style over function.  some better clothes storage would be good.  the mirror along the whole wall by the bed was a bit odd.  there is only one lift so if you are on the 4th floor can mean a bit of a wait."

We had an early flight and went straight to the hotel knowing that check-in wasn't until 3pm the hotel staff made us feel so welcome and made us coffee on arrival they kept our luggage whilst we went out to investigate the local area.  It's a short walk to the water front lots of the lovely squares and the beautiful busy city centre with so many nice shops and restaurants.  We had breakfast every morning and were spoilt for choice we also had an evening meal in the hotel during the stay - everything totally faultless and such friendly staff.  It was my birthday when we were there and the hotel sent up complimentary sweet treats and a bottle of wine what a lovely surprise.  They also sent us an invitation to a free walking tour.  We had the best city break and hope to return again in the future.  Thanks everyone at Hotel Hotel we loved every minute! cons: There was nothing we didn't like everything was wonderful.

We appreciated the en pointe suggestions for dining out. cons: As we had quite a bit of luggage there wasn't really anywhere to store bags / cases other than on the floor.

The staff were really friendly but professional. They had super cool uniforms too.

Firstly the breakfast was so fulfilling and tasty. We loved the combination of buffet and a la carte which gave us plenty of options to choose from.

Secondly the facilities were excellent. Our superior room was very large and the design was just perfect. The garden of the hotel is absolutely stunning and we couldn’t stop looking at it!

Thirdly the location was excellent. Everything was nearby and within walking distance. Quiet at night as well.

Last but not least the hotel’s staff were THE BEST. Due to a planned special occasion I asked the hotel’s staff for different things which were very specific and probably difficult to do so. However the staff went above and beyond and did absolutely everything to help me out and made our stay unforgettable. We will never forget how much effort they put into it and how perfect they made everything for us.

Special mention to Patricia Leonor Tiago Bruno and Mafalda (apologies if I have forgotten anyone!) they are amazing and so helpful and kind. They deserve the best! 

Thank you Hotel Hotel. Thank you Lisbon! cons: Nothing! It was the best!"

The location is great being set just outside of the city centre. A leisurely 7 minute stroll in any direction will get you close to different monuments tour bus attractions and fine restaurants bars and shops. The staff at HH could not be more accommodating and are a very kind group of individuals. They are happy to share city secrets with you and get you to where you’d like to go. The complimentary breakfast each morning had a little something for everyone and HHs terrace provides a calm setting with hundreds of plants and a divine swimming pool for guests to enjoy. We have purposefully left out certain sites on our trip to warrant another trip back to Lisbon and another stay with HH. cons:

Trolley and bus right outside the door. Next to the central squares with shopping food and entertainment. The hotel is very luxurious- down to the bedding. I found it to be a reasonably priced unbelievable experience! Do eat dinner in their restaurant- it is the best in town. cons: You will find this to be the case with all the hotels downtown- the taxis cannot drop you off in front of the hotel so you may need to carry in your bags. It helps a lot if you ask the driver to let you off behind the hotel- the cobblestone streets are in smoother condition and it will be closer.

The hotel is situated on a quiet street with tram tracks so it's peaceful and free from the hustle and bustle of tourists. Yet it’s just a short walk from all the major attractions and central points in the city. Perfect balance!
The service at the hotel was exceptional. From check-in to check-out the staff was impeccable always ready to help with anything big or small.
As for the breakfast—luxury! The spread is worth every penny. All the ingredients are top-quality. Fresh fruits like kiwi oranges pineapple melon and papaya are on offer and the cold appetizers include fresh salmon and other premium selections. It’s a perfect start to the day.
Now the room: in my standard room I had two large windows and a high ceiling (around 3.5 meters) which made the space feel vast and airy. The bed was enormous—truly a King-size—and the mattress was incredibly comfortable. Every detail was carefully thought out from the daily supply of complimentary water to the in-room coffee machine with pods. I have long hair and I usually bring my own shampoo and conditioner when I travel but the products here were from a renowned French brand—top quality so I didn’t need to use my own. The bathroom amenities were all excellent.
The room also offered ample space to work. I set up my laptop by the window enjoying coffee in a comfortable chair—perfect for the times I needed to catch up on work.
The hotel’s restaurant Sebastiao deserves special mention. Don’t even bother looking for alternatives! In Lisbon’s city center there are always people trying to lure you into restaurants with promises of great deals but I can’t imagine a better dining experience than at Sebastiao. The food is a delightful blend of traditional Portuguese dishes and fusion cuisine all made with exceptional quality ingredients. Plus there’s l jazz music to set the mood making it a great spot for a business dinner!!! cons: "

The location could not have been better!  There was a large selection for breakfast the food was delicious. cons: The young men who worked the hotel bar during the day and early eavening were not very friendly.  They talked amongst themselves and seemed bothered when asked for ice or to order food or drink.  We visited on three different occasions so it was not a one time thing.  One evening we asked for ice in our icebucket and they would only give us a glass of ice.  The next night my husband asked the front desk and they had them fill the bucket for us.

Only issue we had was there was a band playing at the hotel bar one evening right below our room which was very loud as well as made our room tremble because of the bass. We couldn’t sleep at all and had to complain a few times before they finally
stopped. The staff was great and ended up changing our room to a higher floor. I recommend if you make a reservation make sure it’s not on the first floor or above their bar. Otherwise everything was great at the hotel!! cons: They shouldn’t have a band playing so loud right below the rooms. It made it impossible to sleep on the first floor as the music bass made our room tremble.
Keep in mind there isn’t direct access to the hotel with a car street is closed to vehicles. You have to walk approx 100 meters to get to the hotel. The staff can meet you to help with luggage so don’t forget to check with them. Staff was great!!!!!"

Very clean; good selection of TV channels; snacks on check-in endless supply of bottled water in the heat....just seemed to anticipate everything you would love to find in a hotel. cons: The location was good for walking to various forms of transportation - Metro the trams - and for hiking to spots like the castle. Lisbon's attractions are spread out rather than concentrated in one area. The area is primarily a touristy district with restaurants and souvenir shops (some very nice some tacky). It would have been helpful to have a market close by such as a Carrefours or anywhere to buy some fruit or nuts. Not everyone likes to eat out for a full meal at every time of the day. If I go back to Lisbon soon I might want to stay in a more ""real life"" Lisbon district to get a better sense of the city's Portuguese (non-tourist) life. Or I might stay at this fantastic hotel and make day trips into other neighborhoods to explore."

Hotel room handled 2 parents and adult son very nicely.  Once we figured out the best place to catch taxi/Uber - location was great!  Right off a lively square. cons: Because hotel is on a pedestrian street little bit difficult to get luggage either up the hill or across to the square.

Breakfast Buffet was lovely staff were great complimentary mini bar was such a lovely gesture. I could go on.... cons: Warning the hotel is on a road without cars allowed so you get dropped off by the taxi on the parallel road and have to wheel your bags... probably not ideal for an elderly person or someone with massive bags. Also top tip get an Uber or Bolt the taxi's from airport were crazy expensive 30 euros vs 12 euros"

Hotel da Baixa,en-us,2024-03-25,2024-03-27,couple,leisure,us,4,2,2024-04-09 02:44:35,pros: We stayed at the beginning of our trip and enjoyed it so much we returned to stay again at the end. The front desk staff (especially Melanie and Martha) provided 5 star service exceeding our expectations and making sure our stay was enjoyable. Breakfast buffet was delicious with a ton of variety and the morning restaurant staff were courteous and kind. The rooms are exceptionally clean the beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are spacious with great water pressure. We switched rooms at one point (thanks again to Melanie for arranging it while we toured the city) and my wife left an AirPod behind. The housekeeping staff found it set it aside and labeled it so the front desk staff could easily locate it later - which made our return flight much more enjoyable. It’s centrally located near a metro station and the train station easy walking distance to tons of sights and restaurants. Cabs are easy to find at Praça de Figueira and the airport transfer service the hotel offers is quick and convenient. End to end just a great experience. Highly recommend. cons: Nothing.

We ordered room service and it was not bad either. The food was cold but at least tasty. cons: It’s not the properties fault but the neighbourhood didn’t feel safe during the night. At least 15 different guys physically blocked our way and aggressively tried to sell us hard dr*gs while we were trying to get to the hotel during the evening (between 19-22:00) not 2:00 in the morning. I don’t recommend to solo travelers or women travelers.
Additionally the cleanliness of the room was not perfect. There were a lot of strangers hair around especially in the shower."

Excellent front desk special kudos for Diogo Seixas he was very attentive for our early arrival took good care of us and our baggage; we'd like to thank for his superb service. cons: Breakfast is a bit pricey however food is amazing.  Room is on a small scale although we booked for a large double room storage is carefully engineered but the closet is still clamped with bedside table not easy to open; so we
gave up to hang our clothes.   If we stay for more night we may request a room with easier access to closets."

little touches - courtesy drinks in mini bar and cafe in the lobby with cakes. 
We don’t usually dine hotel restaurants but we dined twice at Hotel da Baixa in the evening - the food was exceptional! cons: The drinks at the bar are rather pricey €12 for Aperol Spritz is more expensive than Central London. 
Better maps available for tourists - only the tour bus map was available although the receptionist did print off directions when asked."

Hotel da Baixa,en-us,2022-06-07,2022-06-09,couple,leisure,us,4,2,2022-06-14 16:02:22,pros: The hotel was beautiful inside and out. The staff were very nice. They had free pastries and water at the front as well as expressos. We had not planned to eat breakfast at the hotel but it smelled so good that we ended up getting it the next day and it was very delicious. I think it is a lot cheaper if you book with the rate that includes breakfast rather than getting the breakfast separately so I definitely recommend getting the breakfast with the room when you book. They had champagne with breakfast which is awesome. The bed was very comfy and the AC works well which was a must for us as my husband runs very hot all the time. My husband and I also loved the shower. They give you slippers and robes as well. The location of the hotel was also perfect. We have stayed in other hotels in Lisbon and this one was my personal favorite. Next time we are back in Lisbon we will definitely be staying here! cons: I had no issues. Highly recommend!

Friendly and helpful. They’re even went extra mile for me when discovered that drink I wanted was out of stock so they went elsewhere to get it for me. I was touched. Also we had late flight and staff allowed us to leave bags in the hotel after checking out so we could continue discovering city without luggage in hands before our flight.

I want to compliment especially Tiago Leonel Sara and Lynkon for their never ending efforts to inform me and guide me to where I need to go (and more importantly how to get there).  They are true delights on both a professional and humane level.  Oh that infectious smile of Lynkon made me want to return very soon.  They are a credit to your company.

I also salute  you on the spotless condition of the room.  It was impeccable all together. cons: I would simply like to make a few suggestions as regards the room.  I think it would be a good idea to install a grab bar and a more ""roughed up"" surface in the shower floor.  This is especially important for senior citizens (I am 81 years of age).  There really is no way to catch yourself should you slip (I nearly did) in the shower.

My other suggestion regards the esthetic of the ""closet and shelves"" area.  I thought that copying the same lovely pattern on the wall to a roll up shade would be much more attractive than having to look at your belongings when the area is not in use.  It just looks so disorderly and unattractive."

Highlight was that my husband got a bottle of sparkling wine and cakes for his Birthday without us ordering any (I guess they saw in the passport at check-in). We were so pleasantly surprised! cons: Nothing much to say here. We didn't have food at the hotel so can't comment on that. There is no gym which was a bit annoying but walking the Lisbon hills was a great substitute haha

The room was beautiful the bed comfortable the bathroom and shower big and perfect. I looove when there are slippers in the room and there were !!! 
The lobby is beautiful too the bar is superb.
Now of course the best of the best : the breakfast. OH.MY.GOD. My partner said 10 times ""I think I never had such a good breakfast"". It's true it was amazing. ALL the products seem to be homemade and fresh and taste so good. You have everything different breads potatoes eggs bacon sausages veggies (and all of these slightly change day by day) and everything to go with them and sweet choices to die for cakes pasteis de nata of course (amazing) pancakes yogurt granola peanut butter chocolate paste different seeds and so on ! Omg so much I've uploaded a video of the buffet on my google review !
Also the little attentions from the hotel were sooo cute and pleasant !!! First day we got back to our room we had two pasteis de nata waiting for us and a little bottle of ginja that was awesome !!!
Next day they had hot chocolate downstairs (see pictures) with christmas cake ! and in the room we found a little pot with everything inside to make the same hot chocolate as theirs with a note and explanations. We traveled a lot but it was the first time we got stuff like that. cons: I can only put the highest note because it was perfect. I would just say we did miss one thing : more pillows ! Because at home we have like 4 pillows each we are pillow lovers xD in that room we only had 2 little ones and sometimes in hotels you open a closet and can find others but not there there is actually no closet. Maybe if we asked the reception we would have get some more but it really wasn't that important."

The receptionists were very helpful. Very welcoming environment. cons: I recommend that the hotel manager build a reception office that would be pleasant representative and comfortable for workers. There are just a couple of desks in the lobby for receptionists which doesn't look like a proper reception area. Moreover it's quite cold and even windy in that place now which are inadmissible conditions for receptionists' work.

The location was absolutely ideal for us the staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful the breakfast was brilliant our room was lovely always clean and tidy and very comfortable. We received some lovely complimentary gifts in our room and there was fresh water and a coffee maker. We requested a kettle and that was delivered in an instant. And even though we were in a very busy part of the city the room was quiet and cosy. cons: There was nothing we didn't like! Everything was perfect! We wondered if we should have chosen a hotel with an evening restaurant but the reception staff recommended some lovely nearby restaurants and it was always nice to return to the hotel for a late night drink after dinner.
Pestana Rua Augusta Lisboa,en-us,2023-11-27,2023-11-30,couple,leisure,us,4,3,2023-12-28 05:11:18,pros: Amazing location right by the town center walkable distance to everything from the water/Praca do Comercio to Church of St Anthony Castelo Sao Jorge to public transport and other stops like Rossio Square Santa Justa Elevator and just really too many to note down. Amazing streets filled with restaurants and Portuguese Tarts and even hole in the wall spots selling succulent Bifana (pork sandwiches). The hotel itself has sound proof windows so has all the location look and feel of  brand new hotel and window views without sacrificing a quiet nights sleep (not that it is noisy but if you like to sleep in between walks or wandering you can do so in peace). The bathroom is slick and nice and the soaps were moisturising and nicely scented. The soaps and shampoo/conditioner were pumps so felt easy to access. The hotel has decent breakfast selection from cold to hot foods and the complementary welcome cherry drink and tart was a nice welcoming gesture. The lighting in room was beautiful and illuminated certain areas giving this a 5 star feel.  The mini bar fridge had complimentary drinks (1st round stocked) which was unexpected and very nice. The different staff at the front desk were all so welcoming and willing to spend time with us to help share their views of Lisbon. Super friendly! cons: The rooms could be bigger although this is right in an incredible location so I'm guessing this would have been difficult and might not be possible for the area and really if you are spending more time in the hotel I daresay you are doing it all wrong :)

Pestana Rua Augusta Lisboa,en-gb,2023-11-11,2023-11-16,couple,business,ca,4,5,2023-12-17 03:56:22,"pros: The location is amazing. It's literally connected to the arch at the Plaza Commercio (the main square). Every touristy location is pretty much walkable except for the hill with the crucifix. 
Also the staff are so professional and courteous. Special mention to Sarah and Joao -- they are 100% SUPERSTARS! Thank you Sarah for the recommendation of Maria Cantita for lunch (we still remember this fondly) and thank you Joao for making our breakfast chit-chats so memorable. cons: Nothing. It was perfect."

The rooms were a good size spotlessly clean with a fairly large en-suite shower room. The breakfasts were lovely with lots of different choices available.
The staff at this hotel were extremely friendly and very accommodating cons: My only criticism at this hotel was the bed was too firm for me.  I asked for a topper and this was sorted immediately.  I was then able to have a better night's sleep."

I worked for a couple of hours every morning after an exceptionally good breakfast. Great room with an alcove with a desk. Perfect cleaning wonderful beds and bedding in the best quality of cotton. This is a hotel that there are not many of. Could hardly be a better hotel if you want to discover Lisbon and its surroundings. Right on the threshold of the historic part of Lisbon taxi outside the door the tram is 100 meters away and 300 more and there is the subway. Perfect for those of us who love to share a fantastic city and its history. And just as perfect to come home to after a day of 100 stairs steep streets vibrant culture and overwhelming experiences. cons: Everything was thought out down to the smallest detail so there is nothing to complain about. The first time I leave such an overall positive review.

Breakfast was great (homemade items wide variety Buck’s Fizz).
Room for 3 was a king bed and a separate (windowless) room - not totally suitable for our 2 year old but adequate.
Lobby is lovely.
Location for convenience very good. cons: Room was directly above the primary landmark )arch where buskers play music until very late. The double glazing is impressive but inadequate - we would have liked to have known this as we’d have chosen a different hotel.  The hotel maintained there was nothing they could do about it. For the price of the room I’d have expected no sound inconvenience like this and a more constructive response when we complained (response was that they have double glazing and they can’t control what goes on in the street)."

Definitely needed if staying street side but when closed you can't hear a thing. cons: The headboard was glued on in the wrong place blocking power sockets and light switches on one side. Rushed job by the builders. Room service to make the room was crazy early on our first morning when we were still snoozing. So we said not now. They never came back that day and were patchy in the days after. So we just asked for new towels.

Cleaners did a great job and were very thorough. Staff were very attentive and kind. Breakfast was great and there was lots of choice. We had a great stay! cons: Only downside was the bathroom door being glass which meant there was less privacy than we would’ve liked. But this was only a minor thing!

Everything is a short walk away from the hotel about 10 mins to Alfama or Chiado and Rua Augusta is literally at the doorstep.
The staff are extremely helpful and professional. Ivan and Sara at reception are absolute stars and nothing is too much for them. They booked us a perfect 8-hour city tour which was the best thing we did. Rui our guide (he's not really a guide but extremely knowledgeable and a perfect host/guide took us to all the key sites explaining the history and relevance in great detail.
The hotel itself is very clean rooms well appointed and breakfast is very sumptuous. They will happily make anything for you if it is not in the buffet.
Overall a fantastic short trip and we were well looked after at Pestana Rua Augusta. We will definitely stay here the next time we visit Lisbon. cons: Nothing really to fault though bear in mind that as it is a new hotel in a newly renovated building so the walls are thin and you can hear people in the corridor outside the room. Did not really bother us much though."

Loved that everything was quite new and clean. Some of the staff were really excellent. A lot of breakfast options. And the welcome gifts were a nice touch! My compliments to the staff at the breakfast area. cons: If you look past the fact that they just opened and everything is still sort of new: price wise it’s a bit overrated in my opinion. Not the best Pestana hotel we’ve seen. Yes the room was clean (I did find hairs in the shower) and yes the location is very central. However the check-in or reception area is a bit off compared to the rest of the well designed lounge. No privacy while checking in or out just chaotic - not enough space for people and luggage. Our room was on the side where you could hear the construction works on the other side. The room was a bit small not enough space to move with your luggage. No clear welcome sign with phone number of reception or any info about facilities in the hotel. Staff: some were excellent and some just ignore you completely. The service at the bar could be better: more options please not everyone wants alcohol beverages or coke. During our four night stay we had an almost empty tissue box with 4 tissues and nobody refilled the toilet paper - i had to request this that seemed weird to me. It just wasn’t worth it you pay for the location I guess.

I found all staff to be quite nice (reception restaurant cleaning). Also it was my birthday during my 4 night stay and I received a bottle of champagne and brownie (nice touch) 
It’s a new hotel near the river and if you want to go on boat rides it’s the ideal location. 
Coffee machine (no electric jug for tea though). cons: Room a bit on the small side especially wardrobe (enough for one person and for a short stay) no place to put suitcases and the space between the toilet and bathroom sink - a bit of a tight space. There was a bit of construction on one of the days that I intended to sleep in longer but this was once during my stay."

I have some cash (RMB) in an envelop which was placed in a zipper-sealed inner pocket of the bag.  I didn't notice but after we returned home I found it missing.  I suspect someone took the money while we were out sight-seeing.  I would not seek hotel investigation but just want to make people aware of the potential risks of theft even in this pricy (nice location though) hotel.

It makes returning from a long day or eating/drinking and sightseeing downhill. The hotel is in a main tourist area but it was quite in our room. The restaurants around the hotel are not very good but the staff does give OK recommendations. cons: The hotel does not give guests control of their room’s thermostat. I had to call multiple times to have them change termpeature in our room. Overall their dinner recommendations were only ok and were very pricey options.

The wifi was not secure which was highly inconvenient; the hotel insists it was and that it was a foible of iPhones which made no sense when it is the only wifi I encountered in a hotel that said insecure.  Breakfast was not served until 10:30 am ! nor was its included in my room cost which was $350/night.

Again exceptional!  Leonardo showed us around  & explained all areas of the hotel.  Cannot remember all names of those on reception (so sorry) but you were all wonderful!  Today my husband phoned the hotel to make some enquiries about making a booking for next year. He spoke to Arielle (we had met before).  What an outstanding young woman - so so informative beautiful command of the English language & above all a genuinely lovely person.
Last but not least the brilliant young man who was responsible for the cleaning of the communal floor areas.  He would always stop work to allow guests to continue their travels.  Always with a smile & great courtesy.
Huge thanks to you all. cons: Feel guilty finding any fault - bathroom was a little compromised (cleanliness excellent) & a little surprised by how small the pool was (now I’m sounding like a complete diva!). Totally understand that land is at a premium in cities such as the gorgeous Lisbon."

We were helped with our bags before we even got to the hotel. It is located right in the heart of Alfama minutes from the Se (Cathedral) and on the #28 tram route (the classic Lisbon tram route). The bed was comfortable and the room pleasant. Facilities were very good: small pool gym various terraces. Breakfast was very nice indeed with a range of options including items to order outside of the buffet. There was coffee and tea available in their lounge for most of the day. There was entertainment on one evening too. Staff went out of their way to help. cons: Not much. The view from the room (third floor) was obscured by a wall just outside the window!

Loved the architecture + design. The view was spectacular. Sitting on the terrace for a before dinner drink (and one night for an after dinner glass of port) is a must. The staff is exceptional is the terrace lounge. And exceptional front desk staff also - they helped us with restaurant suggestions and reservations. Always professional and kind. Wish we had included breakfast option - not sure why we did not. cons: Would loved to had a bigger bed. We are used to a king-sized bed. However the bed was very comfortable.

We took a large terrace room which tbh isn't that large but had everything we needed and was spotlessly clean! The soundproofing was amazing and this was needed when we had a thunderstorm and when the stupid cruise ships overuse their PA systems! 
I loved the sustainable feel of the breakfasts including refillable glass containers for yoghurt milk and juice. Small amounts of a selection of foods were refilled often reducing waste and à la carte was included in the price. 
There is a super well stocked bar also available on the terrace weather permitting which is lovely to just hang out when you need a break from the bustle of the city.
 Alfamma is a great little part of town which despite the odd tourist trap still had authentic people flavours and sounds. 
I would definitely return and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to family and friends. cons: The invisible steps in the pool!"

Also there was no lighting inside or near the closet so you couldn't see what you were looking at or looking for.

The hotel is beautiful from check-in to the rooms and  being in the heart of Alfama is great. You can jump off Tram 28 to this hotel just as it starts to get super crowded. The selling point of this place is the view and sitting on the patio having dinner and drinks at the property. We always ended our evenings here as it was romantic enjoying cocktails and dinner with provided blankets. the Amenities of the room are good but was one of the few places that charged for provided drinks/snacks in room. The Price for breakfast is too pricey for what is offered but enjoyed a short walk to Antu Alfama.  We had a fantastic stay and would recommend staying! cons:

The property is stunning and the juxtaposition of minimal modern design with centuries old buildings is remarkable. The rooftop is great the breakfast is generous and the rooms are comfortable and meticulously clean. The property is also quiet given its position away from the main road. The staff were very accommodating. I'd definitely stay at Memmo again! cons: The wifi was very poor. The average download speed was between 1-2 mbps in both the common and private areas. You won't be able to make video calls or stream video.

Breakfast was lovely but disorganized. Not enough staff and every morning something different was missing. But it's hard to complain given the setting.

The pool is gorgeous but not really useable (unless you want 20 people sipping cocktails watching your every move)"

Reception were so helpful and made our honeymoon very special. Also very accommodating to our needs. All fabulous comfortable luxurious super clean and of course beautiful. We appreciated the architecture of the hotel and the well placed picture windows which give you views of the beautiful city. Also sampled some of the tapas - delicious! cons: Breakfast service each day. They were short on staff. It was really difficult to get cold milk for the amazing cereal selection (strange but true!). We had to go and find staff (literally wait outside the kitchen until someone appeared) to get things like milk extra water or coffee which was a bit frustrating. Especially as I’m six months pregnant! If they had some dedicated breakfast waitstaff to look after guests that would be a huge improvement.

Great breakfast beautiful views from the roof deck. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was small but probably standard for Lisbon. I'd definitely recommend the hotel. cons: Unfortunately there's a rodent problem on the roof deck. Both nights we saw either a rat or large mouse cross the deck. Other than that the setting is lovely and the view amazing.
We also were given incorrect information regarding train service. We were assured by reception that there was no need to purchase train tickets to Coimbra in advance. We got to the train station and train was sold out. We had to wait 2 hours for the next train.
The free walking tour was not great. The guide did not read his audience. We finally had to leave after 1.5 hours when the guide kept us at the entrance to a public toilet to talk about a mural. Well-intentioned but not enjoyable."

The staff are amazing the terrace view is one of the best in Lisbon I’m guessing and such a great place to have a drink or eat breakfast. Such a beautiful relaxing atmosphere overall! cons: I wish our room were bigger as it was hard to even figure out where to put our suitcases. That said That’s not something they can easily change nor did it really matter in the end because there is so much to do out and about and the outdoor space at the hotel is so inviting that we really didn’t spend much time in our room. I do think they could upgrade their pillows though! They were lumpy and uncomfortable. That would be my only suggestion.

The property was well maintained. The breakfast was very good. The patio areas were great. cons: It was very expensive for what we got - a very small room AC that didn’t work much at night no matter what we did to it and no view. The rates advertised on the internet were much less than what we paid.

Most of the staff is really friendly and accommodating. cons: The room we booked (in a group of 5 rooms) was easily the worst room of the 5 yet we paid the most on Booking. I asked if there was a better room and they insisted rather vehemently it was the better room although the bathroom was the size of one on a small airplane (you could touch the toilet from the bed) and had no deck (unlike the other rooms) and was much smaller. And the AC didn’t work. I asked if there was a way to get a better room especially since we paid so much but the woman at the front desk continued to gaslight me and argue in a really confrontational manner. I’m not someone who complains often so I was polite and genuinely surprised she was so adamant about it. That said many other people on the staff were very friendly and helpful.

Comfortable bed with nice linens. Rooms were clean w/ some a welcome pastry & a nice personal cash snack/drink bar. Walkable location to active area! cons: Rooms were small w/ glass w enclosed bathrooms; concerning when getting up at night particularly.  
Windows have a wall blocking any view with light coming in only through the top; strange & feels quite closed in.
DJ playing loud rock & roll in evening on terrace; don’t fit the ambiance of the lovely space. 
We were leaving @ 7:45 & felt like we were asking a big favor to get a coffee before departure. 
Uber drops you down the street w a bit of a walk that your suitcase wheels will not like. ;)"

Staff were very nice. cons: The cruise ships dock in front of the hotel spoiling the view  loud tannoys from the ships. Rooms are very overlooked by the terraces. Did not want to use the pool because pigeons and seagulls would drink and wash themselves in it. Very difficult hotel to find the hotel need to give better instructions. Hotel very overpriced no coffee machine in the bedroom no netflix no bbc news channel. The hotel was very geared up to their American clients. The hotel is situated in a very unclean area of Alfama.

The receptionist Isa Garcia was extremely helpful and really took great care of us. The barman Jaime was so hopeful and nice. Some other staff members were nice too but I felt that sometimes they weren’t coordinated. cons: 300 Euros per night for the room. Very small room. No coffee machine. Kettle available but due to the incredibly tight room there was no place for placing the kettle to make a drink. 
They have a coffee machine in the living room of the hotel but only after 10 am.
We didn’t have breakfast at the hotel as found the cafes outside much better quality."

There was one person who made our stay turn around was Monica who went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable. cons: The staff was indifferent to Me and wife. We waited 6 hours in a waiting room at the hotel after an international flight from the US. We requested 2 beds and received a full/queen size in an extremely small room with for advanced reservation. Multiple people who came after us were placed in their rooms far in advance of us. It was only after I requested our room were we finally accommodated. by the staff who knew our request upon arrival know we were waiting onsite. In comparison our last 2 nights in Lisbon we stayed at the Intercontinental for the same price and received 5 star treatment with breakfast included and accommodations with an excellent staff location and exceptional customer service.

Also- i don’t understand the in- room bathroom with the curtain thing…. my husband had quite a good time opening the curtain while I was in the shower…. it was pretty funny… however I don’t understand - why not just have a solid wall separating your bathroom from your bedroom?"

The young and enthusiastic staff offer exceptionally friendly service. The hotel is stylishly constructed in the ruins of an old bakery. cons: The pokey ‘Mansard’ room is hugely overpriced at $419 AU per night with a ‘goal-cell’ window without a view. There is only daylight through the top quarter of the window. you have to take two steps up from the floor to see over the blank parapet wall. This outrageous charge does not include breakfast. we have travelled around the world and have never been ‘scammed’ so outrageously.. The architecture only ‘works’ for the superior rooms with a view.

Room: clean and with natural light throughout the day
Pool: next to the bar and restaurant
Bar: nice relaxing quiet environment
Reception staff: Couldn't be more helpful kind and approachable. They all went above and beyond to find us bookings and recommendations for restaurants and spa treatments. cons: Bar and restaurant staff: Although helpful most of the time we did get the impression that sometimes they didn't want to serve us. The orders were also either wrong or things were missing from the orders and most of them time the service was very slow. I would recommend making sure you repeat the order a few times or make sure they write the orders down. 
Pool: The pool was right next to restaurant tables and there were no lounger area next to the pool so you have to walk past people having a quit intimate sophisticated lunch when going in and out of the pool. There were 4 loungers available but they were downstairs and not close to the pool which forced us to sit on restaurant chairs and sofas to sunbathe. I think the pool area needs to be redesigned as the lay out made the experience uncomfortable most of the time we were there."

Location is great to walk around and see most of Lisbon. Room was fine for what we paid. cons: The whole reason we booked this hotel was for the pool. The pool was closed and no communication on that before arrival. It was disappointing. They also had to move us hotels to their other location the first night which was annoying.

We wanted somewhere relaxing to sit and relax in the sun in btw exploring the city so that was great. The hotel staff was accommodating and helpful. Overall good ambiance and vibe of the hotel especially for the price point. cons: The rooms are not sound proofed to the hallway. We could hear all sounds in the morning which made it tough for us to sleep.  We had an issue with our reservation getting switched to the other memmo and confusion.  The staff was accommodating (not their fault of renovations) but I had asked twice if the pool was open during our stay and it was confirmed twice. It was empty and closed when we got there which was disappointing given that was the main reason i booked the hotel.

It's a beautiful from the hotel down liberty street towards the water and there is a beautiful park nearby. The staff were absolutely lovely.

You may be able to call down to the front desk but we didn't try that. They have a bar in the lobby for drinks/coffee but we never saw anyone working there so we never ordered anything.

We cannot recommend this place enough and look forward to checking out their other boutique properties around the world! cons: Rooftop was closed at 4pm on our check in day for a private event.

Check-in was smooth and we received clear instructions about parking.

I had booked two rooms one for my partner and me and one for my parents. Both rooms was very beautiful. The interior design throughout the hotel was very elegant and well-thought-out.

One evening we spent time at the rooftop bar which had a stunning view. We enjoyed snacks and cocktails which were good and the staff were very professional and friendly. Breakfast was tasty but the portions were small so it was good that it was also buffet-style.

All the staff were very nice and professional making sure we were comfortable and enjoyed our stay. cons: However there were some issues. First the hotel could be accessed from two street levels which was new to me and initially seemed interesting. However we realized our rooms on the second and third floors faced a very noisy street making it feel like we were in a basement. The third-floor room was an accessible room which none of us needed and it felt like we were taking it away from someone who might.

In the second-floor room I was disappointed because the bathroom wasn't clean. I found hair on the sink mold on the shower walls and there was no ventilation causing the mirror to fog up and making the room damp. The toiletries were supposed to be refillable but were half-empty when we arrived.

Additionally the hallways on both floors smelled likely due to plumbing issues as there was public restroom on the third-floor."

It was halfway between my conference venue and an easy 30-minute walk down into the old town. There is a supermarket opposite which has its own cheap cafe. The hotel recommended a nearby restaurant ""O Cacho Dourado"" which serves excellent local food. There is a Metro station within a 5-minute walk which will get you into town or with one change to and from the airport (about 30-35 minutes).
My room was very comfortable and also quiet.

We found entering the hotel initially confusing as the entrance wasn't obvious and the automatic doors didn't open immediately. The location was ok not central but we knew that on booking. The highlight of our holiday was the stunning roof top bar with reasonably priced drinks. cons: The major disappointment was that the stunning roof top bar closed at 9pm which meant if we had been out in Lisbon for the evening we couldn't come back to our hotel roof top bar and look at the stunning view.  I was amazed that it closed so early as it is such a huge advantage of the hotel to have this view.  I understand residents don't like late noise but 10pm although still early would have been much better and more reasonable.

The decor is beautiful (particularly the blue tile work) staff is helpful and friendly and location is generally close to activities and restaurants.    Hotel size is also nice.  I like the boutique feel.  Beautiful breakfast. cons: I was disappointed the rooftop bar was closed for remodeling.  I loved the views and having drinks up there last time.  Also my room (the basic) seemed very small for two people w/ lots of luggage from having been on a cruise prior.  I would get a larger room next time.

I need to know the scent for my home! The little touches like the vanity sets bottle of fizz and chocolates robes and slippers. The cakes and sweets available at reception. The roof top bar was beautiful relaxing and fantastic drinks and view. cons: You get what you pay for would I have paid less yes. But it was worth it. Breakfast could be a little cheaper £25 a head is a bit expensive.

Very accessible to the metro stations and overall great feel about the hotel. Even left a complimentary bottle of cava and cake on my birthday! Really nice bar area and overall great stay. cons: The roof terrace is not open over the winter months for renovation. However this is not advertised at all on their website (or when winter months are - we stayed in spring) we only found out from other reviews and then a small notice in the hotel once there. It’s a real shame this isn’t advertised more as it was one of the main reasons we chose to stay here. Breakfast was fine but not exceptional. Glad we tried it but wouldn’t recommend getting it included as there is so many good places nearby.

The hotel is clean with exceptional staff. Eddie Nuno Bruno Hallelujah & hudrigo were fantastic. 
The room wasn’t huge but it was very clean. Hairdryer was very powerful and the complimentary toiletries were fantastic (no need to take soaps shampoo / conditioner as there’s tons) 
The rooftop wasn’t open when we were there due to refurbishment but that did not take away from the hotel. cons: The hotel is bright clean intimate. Great bed linen fab toiletries and bar staff. Lovely extras on arrival chocs and biscuits. Great drinks at bar."

I loved how it was decorated in the main areas. We added the daily breakfast to our reservation and it was definitely worth it. They had a very nice selection of pastries fruits breads cheese and meats out. You could also order hot foods for no extra cost (unfortunately this was not explained to us until our 3rd day). There was also sparkling wine and fresh juices out every morning. The location is about 1.5 miles from the heart of the action so it was quiet but still an easy walk (if you don’t have any limited mobility). cons: My only complaint was the lack of wash clothes provided. I thought it was strange to provide hand towels and bath towels but no wash clothes. I had to bathe with a hand towel which was a little cumbersome.

While the property itself is of exceptional quality and design for us it was the staff at the restaurant and the bar that made our stay in Lisbon outstanding. We became very good friends with Bruno Rodrigo Edir Daniela and Ali. They went above and beyond to ensure that our stay is as comfortable and pleasant as possible. It was their kindness their passion for their jobs and their friendliness to their customers that made a world of difference. It is their efforts that made our stay one of our most memorable experiences in the recent years. Naturally the strategic location of the hotel its stylish design and its superb breakfast also contribute to the overall quality. cons: Nothing comes to mind. Keep up the great work!

The hotel has a traditional modern feel to it and the staff are all professional courteous and helpful. 
We booked a superior room for 3 nights which was really nice and spacious with a very comfortable bed. 
We didn’t eat at the hotel but used the lobby/lounge area for post dinner drinks and afternoon tea all reasonably priced and of good quality. 
We had room service breakfast on one day but chose to eat out on the other days. There is a lovely cafe maybe 30m to the left of the property that serves a great breakfast. cons: I don’t think there was anything major we didn’t like. We booked this hotel for its rooftop bar which was closed during our stay for refurbishment. 
We booked a superior room which was actually down two floors from reception and looked out onto the side of the building into a very busy street with a huge residential building in your eye line. Not one for city views I’m afraid."

Good sized room nicely appointed comfortable king bed (superior room) Nespresso machine with coffee milk and sugar. Also tea pods. We were on front of hotel roadside but with windows closed we slept like babies. Ate dinner once in the hotel restaurant excellent service and food was good. cons: It was a bit of a walk to the core areas about 30 minutes however we like being away from crowded areas. It was an extremely wet day on Lisbon’s very slippery tile sidewalks so on a nice day it will take less time to get to the central area. You have to search a bit for dinner restaurants other than in the hotel. To us these were minor issues.

The room was bright clean and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable. The lobby bar and restaurant areas were also beautifully designed. I enjoyed the little touches such as chocolates left in the room and a surprise treat at check out. The location is fine; not exactly close to the main tourist sites of Lisbon but it doesn't matter when it's so easy to get about. cons: The rooftop area was closed due to the season. I expected the bar to be closed but it would be nice to still go up and enjoy the views and take photographs. While the hotel make clear that the bar is closed in winter I feel the lack of access to the rooftop area in general should be more clearly stated as it was one of the selling points that made me book.

Plus there is no staff at door when guests arrive to let them know where did she go park. If they don’t give you address you will not find garage. Also it’s limited parking and a bit narrow and not easy to park.

I loved the decoration of the hotel very bright and chic with these stunning blue tiles. 
The room was a bit small but I think that is the standard for most Europe capitals! On the other hand the bathroom was quite roomy. Both were beautifully decorated. 
The breakfast was excellent and there is free bubbly! 
The rooftop is very cute although much smaller than I had imagined based on photographs. 
There is bubbly cake and pasteis de nata available at the reception at all time!! What more can you ask for! cons: The rooftop is open to the public and busy during the weekend. On the first night we were turned away without much regard for the fact that we were hotel guests (they could have offered to call in the room when a table became available for example). The rooftop also closes pretty early. 
No gym."

Very beautiful quiet and spacious rooms. Very friendly staff. I recommend the rooftop bar for a drink (or two).

The evening meals in the A La Carte restaurant were superb.  The top floor roof terrace and bar is also a treat.  The general ambience of the of the hotel was one of style individuality and sophistication. cons: For the price paid I would have expected a room with a view on one of the higher floors.  As it was I had two quite small windows one looking out onto a tiny terrace and the other looking out onto a rather unattractive side street.  Whilst Booking.com advertises the rooms as fully sound proof as with most accommodation in heritage buildings this was not the case.

Location was okay. Walk to Rossio Square is 20 minutes more or less. Don't waste your money on taxi. Use uber instead. The most I liked was the front desk staff. At least 3 of them helped to plan my trip. They suggested good restaurants helped with calling to make reservations. Ask them for help!! They also give you an excellent map of Lisbon. They were truely fantastic. FYI Thursdays they have Fado performance and dinner available at the hotel but reserve with the front desk in advance as they can't accommodate all guests. cons: Some of the waiting staff at breakfast. In particular this blondie who checks people in. Fix your face and your attitude."

Beautiful and from the moment I entered the door staff were extremely helpful and warm - till the very end of my stay! Recep staff were great as well and the room was HUGE. Spacious lovely little bay window huge comfy bed sparkling clean toilets. The rooftop terrace was amazing to chill and watch the sunset. cons: Room walls were quite thin once everyone woke up the next morning I could hear the activity outside. Didn't bother me however. The rooftop terrace also gets crowded fairly quickly as it's small so you will want to head up early.

We were upgraded room was big beautifully appointed and bed was very comfortable.

Rooftop bar is excellent. cons: Check in was a bit all over the show think there was a big group checking in so it felt haphazard.

Breakfast was disappointing. Service was terrible staff were miserable expect for one. Choice in buffet was not to my taste…no fresh granola. I ordered poached eggs on toast and received one runny egg on a scone same with pancakes…only 1 received. 

Also response from reception on a couple of occasions was slow or non existent. Tried to call down one evening and after 3 attempts gave in."

Antonio the gentleman who dealt with the taxis and luggage and other things was really so helpful as were all of the staff. cons: The map to the parking garage was a laminated sheet that needed to stay at the front desk.

The property is beautifully restored and very comfortable. The sunsets from the rooftop bar were one of the highlights of our trip.
The breakfast menu was generous and varied in its selections. cons: The hotel uses a very strong air deodorizer which at first seemed pleasant but became almost offensive in its intensity.
My suggestion is if you have a sensitive nose as I do to ask the staff to use the product sparingly. The property is well maintained and extremely clean so there's very little need for a product such as an 'air freshener'"

We didn't eat at the hotel but drinks were lovely and not too expensive. The view from the roof top bar was stunning and the rooms were clean spacious and a lovely interior. Staff were extremely helpful particularly one of the door men (we didn't catch his name) who gave excellent recommendations of things to do in the city guided us to the bus stop and helped us find the most direct route on public transport. Excellent stay and would rebook if back in Lisbon. cons: Our only criticism of the hotel would be that the roof top bar was closed 2/4 days we were there due to it being booked out externally for events. Not a huge issue as lots of other beautiful roof tops in the city and plenty to do during the day but would be nice if hotel guests got priority!

Bar on top had fabulous view and the restaurant in the lobby was very charming and food very good.  The room had thoughtful touches and the bathroom amenities were of a very good quality. cons: Garage was very tricky to get to but that is just because of the position of the building.  Also it was odd to have the WC two floors up from the restaurant.

Friendly & helpful staff at all levels with excellent recommendations for dining & sightseeing. Thank you Rodrigez. Away from the hustle & bustle of the old town but only a 10 minute 5euro taxi ride away. Comfy & quiet rooms with all you need for a good stay. Eating lunch or having evening drinks on the rooftop terrace were memorable. Highly recommend staying here. cons: Breakfast seemed expensive. We have smaller appetites so ate in a local bakery. The roof terrace was a little smaller than expected so be prepared for a short wait at busy times. Its worth it. Service was a bit slow but cocktails were excellent

Good selection at breakfast
Aesthetically very beautifully decorated
About 50% of the staff were nice cons: Due to a technical issue we were unable to have the room we had paid for for the whole stay (we booked and paid 9 months in advance) we were downgraded and only found out about this when we arrived (despite receiving multiple confirmations by email previously). The staff did comp breakfast offer to refund the difference and we had the room we had booked for the second night of our 2 night stay but it was very stressful and some of the staff we dealt with were very unhelpful. 
Cot provided was not very good (sheets on it too small travel cot that kept folding in on itself at one end - not ideal). 
Spotlights outside windows and insufficient curtains / blinds so the room was not dark at night. 
Breakfast service was terrible cold food and took a long time to get hot drinks."

We had a beautiful Deluxe Double Room. Very happy when we saw we were on the top floor. That was a big mistake. cons: Our room was on the top floor which at first we thought was nice but also on the top floor is the rooftop terrace bar. Our room was so NOISY. On our first night there was a private function going on and the noise was terrible. Then you have the noise of all the people leaving walking straight past your door talking very loudly and continuing to be very loud whilst they waited for the lift. Then after that you have the crash and banging of the staff as they clean up and they were also very loudly talking as they were leaving. This then happened again on the next two nights of our stay when guests were using the terrace. We didn’t expect to pay approx €800 for 3 nights and not be able to get to sleep before midnight because of the noise. Not a good idea to have the guest rooms right next to the roof top bar."

I sent a message in advance that we needed two rooms together but in the end they gave us two separate rooms and far from each other which was very inconvenient and we did not get enough sleep at all that night so we had to go to the children through the corridor. When checking out they calculated an additional breakfast for children although it was already included in the price of the room. The cost of children's breakfast on the booking website is 15 but they charged us 20 since a different price was written on the hotel website. In general we were not satisfied the staff did not try to help

2. The shower pressure is very strong which is satisfying after long walks in the city. cons: 1. The most annoying part that really made my stay uncomfortable was the black mold in the shower area. It was completely uncomfortable to use the shower with noticeable molds in the shower head and the walls. This has to be continuously maintained as it affects overall health. 
2. During our 4 nights stay there was only one elevator that worked the other one was under maintenance for the whole time.. i never seen an elevator that takes this long to fix! Imagine the pressure having one lift
3. The hairdryer was very sticky and dirty i don’t think it has ever been cleaned .. 
4. Our window was next to a very busy bar we hear the shouts and the noise while they watch football matches 😅

They didn’t greet you when we came down for breakfast.  They only said “room number? “. Service was very slow when ordering from the menu and they were still putting things out when the dining room opened.  They had the same things every morning so was very boring. The best part was the cleaning.  Room was cleaned nicely every day.  One of the main reason we booked the hotel was for the rooftop bar and it was closed for renovations. Probably would not have booked if knew this ahead of time.

Front Desk stafff was very kind as well and answered all of our questions. Location is good but it is a 25-30 minute walk to the city centre. cons: We were not informed prior to our stay that the rooftop bar was closed due to renovations for the whole 2024 winter season and it was one of the main reasons we stayed at the hotel. Additionally one of the biggest issues is that you can hear everything from the room next door from people going to the restroom to snoring and talking.

No irons so - again - if you're here for work it's not quite the place to be. Make sure to ask if the rooftop - the main banner image on the website and a cited amenity - is actually open. We booked for that reason only to arrive and find out it was closed for renovation.

Next day the lighting in the bathroom was partly broke and had to be repaired.
We in particular reserved a table for dinner in the Portoguese restaurant of the hotel in the morning at the reception.
When we wanted to eat in the evening there was no reservation.

Although the intererial design of the hotel is really nice and - since it is obviously a very old building - the outer walls of the house are almost 50cm thick and solid the building internally obviously underwent a complete make over. As a result the wall are extremely thin and over no privacy with respect to guests from the neighbouring room. Normal conversation from that room could be heard in detail luckily in a language we did not understand dto. for the modest sound of an alarm clock which woke us up together with the sleeper next door and hammering against the wall during the night from our room neighbour complaining that my husband was snoring.

All that is of course unacceptable for a freshly renovated 4-star hotel.."

No kettle. Restaurant food nice but empty restaurant and yet they put the only other couple right next to us.

This should have been clearly stated on the website.  We specifically chose this hotel because of the roof terrace. Also soundproofing is not great between rooms.

The location is great and the reception staff were friendly and useful. cons: There was a leak in our bathroom above the shower. We ordered breakfast in the room through room service. They forgot half of the things that were listed on their menu (cold cuts cheeses). But worst part was the fact that they advertised fresh orange juice and they sent up one that clearly came out of a box. When we called them to inform of the error they lied and insisted it was freshly squeezed that morning. Eventually they sent up freshly squeezed orange juice and you could see the difference even in color. It’s disappointing when people cannot admit their mistakes and they are trying to insult your intelligence. They offer you free coffee & tea  in the room but no water for the coffee machine (a bit ridiculous). Housekeeping came into our room without knocking we were lucky that both of us were fully dressed by that point. I will go back to Lisbon but I will not be staying at this property again.

Staff should have informed me of this event as part of the booking process.  This meant the only option was to order some snacks in the bar area but most of this area was shut off due to the party.  The snacks were cold the service poor and the area to eat was unavailable due to the private party booking.

Not many good restaurants/bars in the area so had to keep getting a taxi into town. Rooftop bar in the hotel was closed for refurbishments which was one of the reasons we booked so would have been good to know that was happening when booking. Our room was directly opposite the window of a bar where people could easily stare in so it didn’t feel relaxing sitting in the window seat either and mainly had to have the curtains shut. There was also a power cut on the last night whilst we were getting ready for dinner which was inconvenient.

The lady who checked us in didn’t even bother to ask whether we like a bathtub or a walk-in shower. Nevertheless she gave us a room with a bathtub that was not even properly cleaned. You can clearly see yellow stains on the tub. By the way this is a four star hotel.

No whole milk for cereal and scrambled eggs and bacon combo poor two half strips of bacon and hard eggs that needed to be cut with a knife. Good location near elegant Liberdade area. cons: I stayed twice first for over a week then returned for one night. On the first stay room was fairly large. On return the holel gave me a tiny room where the bed was 2 feet from the wall. It has an awkward l-shape where most of the room was a corridor. Folks who book should be careful not to get one of these tiny rooms.

The staff is lovely upon check in--offered free champagne/sparkling wine and treats when we arrived which was very nice! Buffet breakfast has a great selection and even includes bottomless sparkling wine which I thought was great for the price! cons: We were staying at this hotel to celebrate our anniversary. Upon check-in the room we were given was smaller (and more disappointing in terms of layout/design) than the room we had initially booked online--this wasn't going to ruin our stay but when we got to our room the A/C unit was not working properly and our room was very hot (it was 85F and humid outside so we would have liked a room to be able to cool down in). Upon letting the front desk know about the A/C they offered to have someone come up and take a look. After going out to dinner and coming back to the room the A/C unit seemed to be working and our room was much cooler (yay!). The hotel had a bottle of sparkling wine delivered to our room for our anniversary (very kind!) but we decided we wanted to wait to drink it a different night since we were very tired when we arrived on our first day -- when we left to go out and explore the city the day the cleaning crew came and removed the brand new (completely unopened) bottle from our room. When we asked the hotel about what happened to our sparkling wine no one could give us a clear answer. Overall the hotel itself was beautiful but not worth the value.

The hotel staff sought to blame it on the two building sites next to the hotel but it was. clear the noise was coming from inside the building.

The front desk was so slow and incompetent we spent over 4 hours checking in trying to get checkin documents and checking out. They collected  payment upon checkin but did not record. I was only able to leave without paying again by producing credit card receipt that they made copy of.  I did end up paying city tax twice to get out. After 1st night we were told to pack our bags to change rooms because front desk put us in wrong room. I traveled for 30 years on business frequently and this is the worst front desk I have experienced. I almost never comment on stays.

The Infame restaurant was better than any other we tried in Lisbon and the breakfast was perfect. But most of all we want to mention how amazing the staff were. The manager Andre helped us to arrange a day trip out with one of the hotel’s recommended local guides Antoinne. We would highly recommend doing this as it helps you to explore the area around Lisbon including the coastline and Sintra. cons: The location is a little secondary and at first glance appears slightly down at heel but it is well located next to a nice square and the city centre is walking distance or a short cheap taxi."

We were given room 311 which was the room with a separate living room in the top of the dome. We also had a lovely welcome gift to mark our special occasion. The staff were knowledgeable about getting around and nothing was too much trouble. It was all clean and the breakfast which was included was lovely with a contintal breakfast choice and a menu to order from also. The hotel has a small paved area outside which has some outside tables. The hotel is on a busy part road but it is still fairly quiet. The area of town is up and coming and so not as polished as the other more popular parts of Lisbon but everything is walkable within 25 minutes from the hotel. I would definitely go back and recommend the hotel. cons: My one and only criticism would be that due to arriving before our room was available and as we had a booking on the otherside of the river we didn't arrive back to our room until late and we didnt get to drink our complimentary bottle of sparkling wine. When we went out the next day we had intended to drink it whilst getting ready for dinner but found it had been taken by the cleaners even though it was unopened. We didn't say anything as we were getting ready to head out. But that would be my only criticism. Plus the main room had been cleaned but the living room area had not been cleaned at all with the glasses and bottle if wine we had bought back from the restaurant still there until we left the hotel.

It is also located right next to a small courtyard/square with wonderful restaurants. They’re open til 1:30 in the morning. Josephine’s was my favorite- try their tea with fresh cinnamon sticks ginger orange lemon and mint. Outrageous. The hotel has a wonderful staff and an excellent breakfast included with your stay. Bottles and bottles and bottles of cold complementary water at your disposal. Massive bathroom with wonderful products.  Our room had two humongous French doors that looked out into the courtyard. The bed and the sheets were very comfortable. The linens were white crisp fresh and new.  They also welcome you with slippers and a very nice touch.  Diogo greeted us and answered our every question kindly and generously. He sent us a map of the area on WhatsApp which was very helpful. The hotel is a short five minute walk away to the world famous Tram 28.  The building is absolutely gorgeous. The next time I am in Lisbon I am sure I will be returning to Hotel 1908. cons: The courtyard had many rats running through it all night. I was afraid to enjoy the courtyard.

André (hope I spelled it right ) was an absolute rock star.  His maps and suggestions for places to visit were so good but not as good as his restaurant recommendations.
We would never have found the places he sent us without him.  He truly made our stay in Lisbon very special.

The bathroom was also nice with a rain shower head lovely shampoo conditioner body wash with a heavenly spa like scent. Breakfast was also very nice with a large spread of pastries fruits yogurt with lots of different toppings meats/cheeses freshly squeezed orange juice plentiful coffee and made to order egg dishes. cons: the location was a little sketchy with several deserted buildings nearby some boarded up some under construction. Several empty storefronts also.  It is across the street from Cervejaria Ramiro where we had dinner reservations. It is close to an alley way with ton of ethnic foods especially Indian foods/shops just down the road. Easy walk to some decent eateries.

Close to both Martim Muniz and Intendente tube stations and on the 28e tram route and  well connected for buses.  20 mins to the airport and walking distance to the town.

We loved the size of the bathrooms in the rooms.  We were blown away with the fantastic morning breakfasts.  The staff was amazing and extremely helpful.  We couldn't have asked for better service.
We were a party of 11 adults requiring six rooms. I forgot to book two rooms for an extra two days for some of our party.  The staff made it happen and we found out a secret about the fourth floor.  The hotel usually doesn't book the fourth floor because of the ceiling architecture of the roof makes the ceiling not as tall in some places.  However these rooms are huge and our married children loved them.  The fourth floor is were you find the real value. cons: "

Each other morning we were brought a special dish. The breakfast looks so good shame all the bread has dairy! We appreciated the special attention in the end.

Room itself was quite nice and modern. 

Breakfast was super good. cons: Sadly it was quite noisy since it is in the city center basically and the windows were not soundproof. Neither was the door of the room.

Room was quite tiny not much room if you are travelling with suitcases etc."

My advice if you are going with local rent a car companies read every sentence click to every link as voucher go to terms and conditions where you be surprised by the real price 
Never trust to the price that they give you online
You’ll have additional triple payments while picking the car. It’s a major problem in Lisbon now
Go with famous trustworthy companies instead. 
Avoid dealing with Drive on holidays and Rentalcars. com"

Everything has been thought through and the reception staff were amazing. Treated me like family rather than a customer. Breakfast had an extensive range and everything was delicious.

Andre greeted us and then sat down with us to create the perfect itinerary in detail booked a private tour of Sintra for us (very much worth the price) and answers all of our questions.  The next concierge helped us cancel and rebook our next hotel in Porto since I was getting notifications that the prices were dropping from what I originally paid.  That was so nice of her to do for us.
The breakfast was the absolute best I have ever experienced.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Fantastic coffee (from the barista) and eggs cooked to perfection.  I’m still craving their granola and fresh yogurt.
Our room 111 was fabulous.  We had the  curved room with approximately 280 degree views and balconies.  Wait until you see these French doors and high ceilings on the first floor - incredible!  The giant bathtub was another highlight of the room.  
Finally the design and decor is a show stopper.  We were on a bus ride back to city center and my boyfriend was looking at rooftop tile art.  He nudged me and said “wow look at that one.”  I said “wow it’s beautiful” then 2 seconds later I said “hey that’s our hotel!”  Don’t forget to check out all the amazing design details when you’re there. cons: The only thing I can think of is having some drawer space in the closet for clothes.  There were only hangers."

We had orignially booked an airbnb but upon checking into the airbnb we realized that it hadn't been cleaned and wasn't ready for new guests. After canceling that reservation we found the 1908 Lisboa Hotel on short notice. Even though the airbnb situation was stressful I am glad it happened because it gave us the unexpected pleasant opportunity to stay at the 1908 Lisboa Hotel!

Breakfast was delicious. They had just about anything that you would want. I would stay there again in a heartbeat! cons:

All amenities you could want in the room such as coffee machine slippers bathrobes vanity kit big TV. The shutters shut out any noise and light. The bed was extremely comfortable. 
Catering - the best breakfast I have ever experienced in any hotel. Everything was freshly prepared and included local delicacies and option for a hot meal such as omelette pancakes or eggs benedict etc. Literally there was something for everyone and I am already missing these breakfasts. We ate dinner there on our last night and wish we had eaten there sooner rather than at one of the hyped up restaurants I had booked. Food was delicious - we really enjoyed the crab rice octopus with sweet potato and cheesecake. You can tell there is alot of passion going into the overall catering. 
Reception - outstanding. Andre was a mine of information super friendly. His guidance literally made our trip. Katrina also always had a smile and was super helpful.
Bar - great cocktails and great staff
Location - its very close to get the tram/bus or walk to central areas. Turn left out of the building and take a walk through Intendente to see some of the old tiled houses. Nice cafes like Palma close by and one of the best seafood restaurants in Lisbon across the road (Ramiros). There is a supermarket with pharmacy and ATM across the road too. cons: N/A"

The restoration of the building couldn't have been done better. Beautiful dining room. Regular size rooms. Impressive and very well finished marble bathrooms with black vintage-like plumbing. 

Whilst not right in the center being Lisboa a very walkable city this becomes meaningless.

Very easy and friendly check-in with some well thought perks for the guests such as Google maps layers with many itineraries. Breakfast including a-la-minute kitchen options exceeded expectations. 

Vibrant and lively atmosphere in the little square where it is. Perhaps a bit noisy but no annoyance whatsoever when in the room.

Destaque para o André que se esmerou em nos fazer sentir em casa  apesar de problemas pelos quais o hotel passou (internet e tv). Gentil delicado e atencioso fez com que tudo ficasse mais leve. A incansável  Mafalda sempre atenta e o Edu que trabalha no bar. Valeu!
O hotel fica em um bairro de imigrantes.  Ali se convive com a diversidade. 
Muito perto do centro. Pode-se fazer tudo a pé .
Os quartos são muito confortáveis. cons: Do café da manhã. Achei com poucas opções de pão e muito voltado para aqueles que apreciam ovos com bacon.  No cardápio inclusive  tem ovos de várias formas. Ótimo para quem gosta. 
As pessoas com intolerância alimentar  gluten ou lactose devem avisar à equipe . Se pedir  eles providenciam. Mas não estão preparados."

Sente-se o cuidado extremo com que todos ali conspiram para fazer da experiência de estar no 1908 algo inesquecível. Armadas de sorriso fácil e pronto no rosto as pessoas que ali trabalham são a ⭐️ estrela que falta para as 5 estrelas que não tem. A cama é super confortável fofinha e apetecível os utensílios no quarto são de um esmero e bom gosto indescritível. Desde o shampô à máscara hidratante a loção corporal os turcos de banho o roupão chinelos frigorífico ou mini-bar tudo a condizer. Mais: oferecem na chegada um wellcome here delicioso e vários wellcome drinks. Fica numa avenida super barulhenta mas NÃO se ouve nada dentro do quarto. Fiquei no segundo andar. O restaurante tem pratos especiais a saber a nossa casa. O pequeno almoço com os ingredientes frescos como os ovos cozinhados como se pede na hora. Aconselho mesmo. Na minha vida profissional na Indústria Farmaceutica há 34 anos tendo passado por alguns hotéis com 6 estrelas (Dubai) este não fica nada atrás. Para terminar: adivinham o que vais querer… parabéns. cons: Não se aplica mesmo!

Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,en-gb,2024-11-22,2024-11-25,couple,leisure,gb,4,3,2024-11-26 10:53:35,"pros: I loved everything about this hotel! First and foremost the staff - they work incredibly hard to provide first class friendly service. They go out of their way to make your stay special and cannot do enough for you. By far the best service I have ever experienced in a hotel. 
When we arrived we were given a free upgrade and breakfast package which was a pleasant surprise.
The location is perfect close to the waterfront and to one of the main squares which leads you towards the city centre where restaurants and shops are plenty. There is a tour bus that stops just opposite the hotel. We also did the walking tour that the hotel organises for free which was well worth doing. We were taken to see the Christmas lights and Christmas market and really enjoyed the company of the tour guide.
The hotel is immaculate with lots of nice customer experience touches such as the complimentary sweets and ice cream machine in reception the bowls of fruit and nuts around the hotel the coffee machine and soft drinks in the lounge and the tasting hour each evening. On the lower floors you can see parts of the original wall that stood there centuries ago which they have curated into an exhibition along with other artefacts. 
Breakfast was plentiful and we also ate lunch and dinner here during our stay which were both delicious and good value for money. 
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. cons: The bed was very large and spacious but the mattress was very firm a bit too firm for me."

The access to snacks 24/7 was also amazing. However the best part of Corpo Santo Hotel are the wonderful employees. They treat you like family and make sure you have everything you need. 

We especially appreciated the two complementary tours provided by the staff. We learned so much from Sérgio on the afternoon tour. He also gave advice about other activities to do in Portugal. 

Ana was an amazing concierge! 

If I am ever in Lisbon again I am definitely returning to Corpo Santo Hotel! cons: There wasn’t anything of concern."

Close to pink street and Timeout markets.  Staff everywhere to open doors etc….

The hotel offers free 2 hour walking tours to sign up for at 10:30 and 4:00.  We walked up to the castle he took multiple photos of us.  He was excellent in explaining the history of the hotel and the city.  The hotel is absolutely a 5* in every aspect.  I would give it 10 stars! At 5:30-7:00 is happy hour every day with wine tastings and free cocktail.  The lobby is filled with an assortment of candy an ice cream machine hot dogs and canapés and cake slices.  A very convenient location and 5 minutes away from The Time out market.  The room has a window that is sound proof from the outside noise the a/c is excellent our room was very cold the way we like it.  The hotel management knocked on our door twice each day to ask if they could get anything for us.  And at night they fix your bed.  The towels are extra large and nice.  I think the mirror must be fog free.  And the makeup mirror is great. Many English speaking channels on the tv many lighting choices for the room the pillows linens and bed are perfection. Our room had a gorgeous hand painted signed mural on the wall of a scene in Lisbon. They furnish bathrobes and slippers. The bathroom shower is an amazing experience the shower is a rain shower head and there’s buttons on the wall with your choice of green lights red lights and relaxing music with sounds.  I’ve never experienced it in any other hotel.  And the bath gel and hand lotion from Molton Brown smells so nice I’m going to find out where to purchase it especially relaxing ylang-ylang.  The mini bar is filled with complimentary drinks including cokes Fanta and sparkling water.  There’s a nespresso coffee machine and also hot water kettle for tea and Nescafé. You also get a complimentary midnight snack available 11:00-7:00a.m. at the reception- soup of the day sandwichescheese and smoked sausages fruits and desserts. cons: Nothing

For the hotel itself it’s in a central location with some pretty good facilities including a spa massage service gym (gym is a bit small but got everything you need) bar with great food and drinks fancy restaurant and to top it off and a really nice lounge area on the bottom floor right alongside the original walls of the city (they discovered the walls when they were excavating to build the hotel!)

Rooms are spacious (ours even had a small balcony) quiet and the beds are super comfortable.
The standout of this hotel is the service. 

The walking tour with Sérgio was fun and informative and he was genuinely interested in our day what we got up to and how we were enjoying our stay.

Breakfast service was very personalised with Christopher checking in and nothing was too much trouble for him and the staff (bubbles for breakfast is a nice touch!)

And lots of little things such as complimentary snacks and drinks (including daily restocking of the minibars ice cream machine and even snacks on the individual floors!) and attentive staff who were always there to help advise on what to do and where to go for tours or just a night out.

An amazing experience I hope to come back here again. cons: I actually can't fault anything."

We used the hotel as a base 3 times this summer. Feels like CSH was our home in Portugal. Every staff member was truly excellent and nothing was too much trouble. Also the hotel goes out of its way to provide value for money with free minibar snacks lobby snacks drinks and free ice cream 24/7. I have not seen this in a jotel before. While other hotels try to squeeze as much money out of guests as possible CSH tries to give as much free stuff as possible. They are your “old friend” in Lisbon.

This will be the first time we in our travels that the hospitality and service of the staff of a hotel is going to make it difficult to find a match. To start with the location of the hotel is great the bedrooms beautifully appointed and spacious the minibar is free and let's not forget the table of treats in the hall and in each floor. The free-of-charge walking tours provided are a wonderful way to learn about the city. Special mention to Bernardo and Ana García what a blast! The tour with Ana was such a wonderful way to keep discovering more interesting things about the city. Not only did we learn historical details but also got food and authentically Portuguese shopping recommendations such a great touch! Lena the masseuse who treated me did a terrific job working on all the spots I requested; and Christopher was so kind and accommodating for breakfast always wanting to provide the best experience.

The hotel is in a great location. Staff are extremely polite and helpful. Our bedroom was very spacious and clean. We paid extra for breakfast one morning and it was really exceptional. A full basket of gluten free breads and cakes were provided in addition to a large range of other choices. 
There were many extras provided by the hotel: a free 20 min massage historic walking tour lots of free snacks in the lobby and hallways free wine early evening and complimentary bar in the room with beers and soft drinks. cons: I would stay here again due to the staff location and all the added extras. There are just a few things I would love to see improve:
1) The bedrooms are large and spacious but really lacked a ‘wow’ factor for a 5 star hotel. It’s a very business like room everything completely beige with a very mass produced desk. I’d have loved more individuality to the room and a more homely feel. It needed some local art on the wall a velvet sofa and maybe some marble. 
2) The room price was high and at this price I feel all the room fees should include breakfast. I would have rather had breakfast included and less of some of the extras such as free sweets and ice cream. 
3) I felt there was some wastage with paper from the individually paper wrapped wooden spoons for the ice cream. Stainless steel spoons that can be reused would be better for the environment. I also needed a spoon in the room for tea and coffee as I didn’t like the cinnamon sticks provided."

Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,en-us,2024-05-23,2024-05-28,couple,leisure,us,4,5,2024-06-04 15:35:09,"pros: Entire staff very friendly helpful courteous and professional.  Small buffet with snacks/coffee/ice cream machine (very popular) coffee and water was a nice option.  Breakfast in the restaurant was a great value and very good food and service.  Had a couples spa treatment (20 min included at no cost with the room and added extra time) that was exceptional.  This is truly an historic hotel with a small museum with it's history/articfacts/reading room on the lower level. cons: Very little that I didn't like but we were on the top floor and due to the architecture of the building the ceilings in the room we had were vaulted.  If you are 6'0"" or taller just be careful in certain spots of the room as the headroom is a bit lower.  But I would stay in the same room again no question."

Old but filled with love and passion of staff. Once you checked in you will not want to leave or choose another place for next time visit. cons: The only small thing that we disliked was the weird noise that emerged right from somewhere of wall where the bedhead is. It occurred every single night and not been able to figure out wha was causing it leakage or something else… it was a bit disturbing during night time since all the lights were out and quiet a little leaking sound would sound very disturbing!

Upon checking in to our 12 day stay to checking out everything was perfect. All colleagues were professional and treated us with class.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Your close to everything and main attractions aren't far. The everyday 24hr snacks in lobby were great! The Bistro restaurant was very good and it's nice to have great food in your own hotel.
The massage services were very professional on lobby floor level and you even get 20 min free on 1st visit.
The room had great views and being there for the 50th Anniversary for Portugals freedom allowed us to see/hear everything.  Comfortable beds and decent tv w many channels. Free snack bar in room. Everything wad superb! 
The concierge went out of his way to find me a Portuguese pastry but when he failed he had the kitchen make me some. How great wad that!!! cons: I'd say my only complaint is each morning they have complimentary breakfast which was good but the colleagues working don't have a system down. One day I'd get bread offered and next day I'd have to ask. They seem to not work together and I'd have to ask for a refill or an item table next to me was given but I wasnt."
Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,en-gb,2024-04-03,2024-04-06,couple,leisure,ph,4,3,2024-04-26 04:12:55,"pros: What I particularly loved about this hotel are the extra services they offer to the guests.  They clearly have the guest in mind -- from the free walking tours to massage to snacks at the lobby -- certainly going beyond the extra mile.  The staff was wonderful very engaging and would have always something to talk about with the guest not stiff but very naturally friendly.   The location is not in the very busy part of Lisbon but a very short walking distance to the site so it's very nice to wake up in the morning to some quiet time.  

We got a large room more than enough space to open our two big luggages and additional shopping.  It had a small balcony that looks out to the street I enjoyed having my coffee from there in the early morning just as the city is about to wake up.  The bed was very comfortable the toilet and bath was huge.  Perhaps my only comment would be the shower area where you have to step into a tub and there was not a hand rail to hold  on to just the swinging glass partition.   It wasn't a bother to me but might be an issue for senior citizens.  (the music in the shower and the changing lights were a pleasant surprise nice to play the relaxing music while taking the shower).

Breakfast was very good and the wait staff/servers very efficient and very good really kudos to them!  They add to the wonderful experience in this hotel.

The old city walls in the hotel basement was amazing!  Imagine having part of history just below the hotel we had originally intended to enjoy some drinks there because it looked so cozy and we just wanted to take in the beauty of the place but sadly we didn't have much time.  At least I have something to look forward to next time.

I really really highly recommend this hotel! cons: No handrails going into the tub for the shower."

Our kids stuffed their bellies with unlimited ice cream and we unwound with the included happy hour each evening.

I especially enjoyed the steam room and sauna! Such a wonderful gem to use at the end of a full day of walking!

Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,en-gb,2024-02-24,2024-02-28,couple,leisure,nl,4,4,2024-02-28 22:32:36,pros: Everything was excellent. Clean rooms super friendly staff small but comfy gym (they partner the second one which is bigger ask on reception) really good location. Molton Brown cosmetics in the bathroom Lavazza coffe capsules. We also appreciated complimentary minibar and snacks everywhere. In the evening there is a possibility of wine testing for free we never tried but the idea is nice. cons: Breakfast is served with classic restaurant approach when you have to make an order and wait while eating “starters”. Although food was perfect in terms of quality the time you forced to dedicate to waiting is too long in most cases (on Sunday we spent 35 min just waiting eggs to be prepared). Thus maybe just avoid to book with breakfast if you have busy schedule in Lisbon.

The staff in this hotel are re-engineering the word service to be guest-centered. The hotel is a historic site . It is situated in the middle of everything you want to see in Lisbon.  The metro station is dew meters away. The area has many restaurants. The hotel's breakfast offerings are out of this world. In addition the hotel staff run their own city tour twice a day. The message spa is accessable to all guests. I can go on and on. You need to come and stay here. cons: 
Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,en-us,2024-02-09,2024-02-14,couple,leisure,us,4,5,2024-02-23 00:48:18,pros: This was our best stay anywhere im our travels 25 years of extensive. We’ve stayed in high end hotels in different cities but the care here was beyond expectations. The room was gorgeous spacious super clean tastefully decorated and we had 1 and a half bath with a partition separating the sleep area from the living area. The closet space was more than we needed and the snack at night was a great touch. The historic area downstairs was a nice place to relax and have scotch and their daily wine hour was fun. We definitely recommended this hotel to anyone and everyone. Oh the breakfast was always delicious with lots of variety the bar has some fun cocktail creations and the restaurant did not disappoint. The staff goes above and beyond every minute of every day. cons: Nothing

Good location near bars and restaurants. What makes it exceptional is the staff who are very welcoming and helpful. A special thank you to Reginald Badsam and the young man who made the effort to come outside to offer a wine tasting and some Portuguese tapas. cons: Some of the hotel food was nice but it was variable. The room service meal on the last night was much too salty.

Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,en-gb,2024-02-15,2024-02-18,couple,leisure,gb,4,3,2024-02-19 10:08:35,"pros: The helpfulness of the staff stands out - that went for everyone who worked in the hotel. 
Breakfast was outstanding - fruit cold meats cheese eggs bacon mushroom - before you even start the main breakfast. 
Complimentary snacks both in the room (minibar) and in hotel reception.
We ate in the restaurant on two occasions once from the bar menu and later a la carte - both times excellent.
Jacuzzi sauna steam room and 20 minute massage if you wanted it.
Room was spotless. Sensory shower meant you often stayed in longer than intended.
The room with the historic ruins under the bar is a great place to sip a glass of wine and relax.
Finally the location is ideal. It is 5-10 minute walk from city centre attractions/shops. Trams and Metro also nearby. cons: Nothing!"

The staff is very polite and accomodating free food and tours are offered and the restaurant works all day long. The rooms are spacious (we had a Superior Double) and the towels were changed everyday. The food served at the restaurant was tasty. The lobby on -1 floor has some amazing relics of the city's walls totally worth visiting. cons: The hotel lacks luxury and perfection. The building from the outside doesn't give the impression of a 5* hotel the restaurant area needs upgrading and the decoration of the rooms needs some care too (artworks rugs and furniture). All in all the hotel is a bit overpriced.

The staff could not have been nicer. We loved the building itself and the historic archaeological findings in the lower lounge are not to be missed. The bar is excellent and the bartender really knows what he's doing. The included breakfast was outstanding. The rooms are very large in this hotel but the bathroom (in our room) was a bit small. Loved all of the free food in the lobby (ice cream fruit candy desserts). cons: Corpo Santo is located very near Lisbon's famous Pink Street which is a series of bars. It was loud in the middle of the night.

Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,en-gb,2023-08-31,2023-09-08,couple,leisure,gb,4,8,2023-09-18 15:59:14,"pros: The staff are the biggest selling point and draw to this hotel. Everyone was friendly especially the front desk and guest services staff. We really appreciated the efforts from Anna Miguel Nuno Gonçalo Ling John and the guys who greet the guests at the door. This is my second stay at CSLHH and as I said before there are plenty of 5* hotels and perhaps there may be some with better decor or facilities but as long as you keep up the high-standard of customer service you will continue to get booked up. 
The hotel overall is very clean and has a very cosy home-away-from-home feel. The freebies are a nice touch including but not limited to ice-cream and snacks in the front lobby and the free evening drink and ‘midnight’ snack. The free walking tour is very unique and good enough to be a paid service. Anna did our tour and you can tell she is passionate about the city and very knowledge with history. 
The full length mirror was great and it was helpful to have an iron and iron board in the room (without requesting it). However the standard of the iron and the board itself (kept collapsing) was poor. 
The location is brilliant as it’s close to many of the tourist sites and the hotel can help you to book personalised tours if desired. cons: These aren’t major gripes but perhaps areas of improvement. We only had breakfast in the common room downstairs one time but in honesty we wouldn’t have returned (even if we had further days left). The food was average at best. The service was again excellent. On the contrary the room service food is to a high standard (including the breakfast delivered to the room). 
It would have been really helpful to have a keyhole in the room as it felt slightly unsafe when someone knocked on our door and we weren’t able to check their identity prior to opening the door. Furthermore the bathroom door didn’t have a lock. But this is a small detail."

We had lunch there a couple times and was great. Nice little wine list. Staff very helpful and friendly. Room was spacious.  Concierge (all of them) very knowledgeable about local food scene and good reference if you want to confirm if the restaurant choices you made are authentic or traps.  They are happy to provide other options as well. cons: Location is at bottom of the hill so traversing by foot to dinner at nights in nice clothes takes some adjustments and effort and you are likely to break a sweat. And don’t even think about heels ladies.  It’s ok the footwear being practical seems to be the norm out of necessity there.  Exterior awnings seem a little tired and worn but inside is very clean.  The jacuzzi wasn't super warm or working well. The area around the hotel seemed a little sketchy with the skateboarders and what sometimes looked like homeless around the church across the street.  We didn't feel in danger but it was a first impression that initially concerned us.  It’s a highly trafficked area and the major tourist spots behind the Square are very close.

Modern design of the hotel with fancy unique additions like a shower with SPA music and luxury changing colors of light ( I have never meet similar at any hotels before).

The two complimentary tours offered by the hotel were WONDERFUL...small groups with guests only. Both are walking tours so be prepared for steps hills rocky sidewalks but a lot a full facts and history. The staff was extremely helpful and full of knowledge. The HOHO bus stop is across the street so that was convenient. Our room was modern clean and big. The complimentary breakfast was not a buffet but you order off a menu! Each evening they serve wine and hors d'oeuvres along with 24/7 soft serve ice cream! We highly recommend this hotel planning to stay again and at their other properties! cons: Our stay was too short! Everything was wonderful.

Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,en-gb,2023-07-16,2023-07-19,couple,leisure,gb,4,3,2023-07-22 10:38:53,"pros: This is a property in a class of its own!
It is 5* in every aspect you would expect like standard of rooms service etc- but Corpo Santo Hotel offers so much more:

There is a chic to the decoration of common areas and accommodation - for instance with beautiful old letters and books displayed on side boards… hand painted wall pictures…and period features: our room had the old huge wall safe inbuilt ( the building was a bank in its previous incarnation) and the most mind-blowing thing of all…. the incredible lounge which incorporates beautifully part of the 13th century fortifications which were found on the extensive building work necessary to change the building into a hotel.

The breakfast was a feast for body and the eye…. Eggs freshly prepared for each guest ( the perfect poach egg!) …served in little enamel pans tea served in heavy Japanese-style teapots…..

But a sixth extra star goes to the staff who all without fail go over and beyond their remit. Nothing is too much. They thrive under the guidance of the guest relations manager Pedro Falconi. Pedro himself offers 2 free guided walks per day to give an insight into the beautiful city of Lisbon. He does that with so much care and love…. it feels like we have made a friend for life! Thank you so much Pedro!

I won’t even go into detail of all the other loving little treats Corpo Santo Hotel hold in store…. an ice cream machine water cakes and fruit at all times in reception a free 20 minute massage for everybody….

We can’t wait to return! cons: We liked everything"

Upon my arrival the greeting was unforgettable I was immediately taken care of. My luggage was taken to my room the room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  There was nothing lacking. After seeing the fully stocked stacked fridge with snacks sodas and water I smiled to myself yes! Iron safe water awesome rain shower with led change lights and spa sounds I'm loving this hotel. A Free massage 24 hr ice cream complimentary umbrella when it rains free water to stay hydrated going out or coming back in beautiful historic hotel with basement lounge and (snacks/juice) that I discovered one evening. The mouth watering midnight snack of assorted soups sandwiches cookies pastries and drinks after a long day out was a welcoming sight. The restaurant was beautiful and the meals were tasty.
What I remembered most was the helpfulness of the staff. The free tour with Pedro Falcao was an amazing introduction to Lisbon. If you miss this tour you missed out on the history of Lisbon and the significance of the historic hotel. Pedro is a walking history book of everything Lisbon. If you need help booking tours places to eat shopping ect he knows it all and will go above and beyond to help you thank you Pedro.
 I want to also say thank you to the one hotel staff member that went above and beyond to ensure that I arrived at the correct train station and was able to board my train to Porto. I was so grateful for this as a female solo traveler to receive that whatsapp call from the hotel just to make sure everything was OK. I Can't wait to return to Lisbon and Corpo is my new home away from home😁❤️ cons: There was nothing to not like"

and sharing it with guests.

when my husband sprained his ankle and he organised ice for him and offered to arranged medical attention. Nothing  was too much trouble for him. Thanks Pedro.

Big shout out to Pedro and Andre.  The hotel offered 2 complimentary walking tours hearty breakfast midnight snacks pre dinner snacks and there’s an ice cream vending machine in the lobby. After a long day of walking the hills of Lisbon we availed of the complimentary massage. The housekeeping is impeccable. Our room has a terrace that has views of the Pink Street.  The mini bar is complimentary and there’s a Nespresso machine if you don’t feel like going down to the lobby for coffee.  A pillow menu is available depending on your sleeping needs. I’ve never seen this in any other hotels before.

Staff members are available should you need anything but they also are not intrusive if they understand their guests may not need as much guidance (which was my case as it was not my first time in Lisbon). They are also incredibly patient should you want to try and speak Portuguese no matter how poorly. The staff is definitely what will make Corpo Santo my go-to hotel for all future visits in Lisbon. cons: The hotel has invested in soundproofing however noise from the street can still be heard when passerby are being loud. You can also hear when other guests are not being considerate and talking loudly in the halls or stomping their feet and dropping their suitcases on the floor in their room but that would happen anywhere. 

As noted by many before the food is nothing exceptional but it is perfectly adequate when sticking to simple dishes and there is plenty."

Corpo Santo Lisbon Historical Hotel,en-gb,2022-11-29,2022-12-03,couple,leisure,ro,4,4,2022-12-07 14:22:27,"pros: This hotel was a pleasant surprise.
The staff is very kind and professional I would like to mention Miguel from the lobby who is extraordinarily happy kind ready to help and very natural in his job. 
I had a superior deluxe double room which was a very confortable and spacious room (around 40/50 mp2). 
The rooms and the service are definetly of a high level according to a good rated 5 star hotel. 
I really enjoyed the general attitude of the hotel to be generous with the guests: snacks / drinks / sweets / fruits complementary in the lobby mini bar completmentary 2 x refill of minibar / day.
I also enjoyed their shower with ambiental lighting and music. 
The room service is very good we had a club sandwich. cons: The brakfast is fundamentally wrong. This is a shame becouse I know the hotel made great efforts in all areas including the Breakfast. 
It’s ok to replace the buffet with a la carte breakfast ONLY if the a la carte breakfast is better than buffet and this is difficult to do requires lot of creativity. 

In current breakfast the menu is very very poor. 
They dont have in menu things they are actually seve to Brakfast drinks and bread for example. You always have to ask or to guess what kind of coffe they have what kind of juice what kind of bread and so on.
They also have important things missing from the menu like cheese olives. They dont have in u hummus/guacamole/or other things like that. It’s a very basic menu which I have to mention that offer good varienty of eggs.

The breakfast desserts are ok but not the american pankcakes which were a big fail: I ordered pancakes and hot something like a cake muffins without any taste of pancakes. 

I hope the hotel will do something to change the breakfast becouse I would really like to come back here.

I had very high expectations coming here and was quite impressed overall.
While the rooms public areas and facilities didn’t exactly scream 5-star hotel you could see that they really made an effort. The building a historic one was well-kept with a lot of personal touches and perks (including but not limited to complimentary massages cocktail hour snacks and minibar). 
What really stood out however was the service oriented staff. From the front desk to the concierge bellboy and everyone I crossed path with; you could feel that they put the guests’ best interest as the highest priority. It was both a service with a smile AND going to the extra mile. 
Special shoutouts to Victoria who helped me getting my soaking wet shoes dried Diana and Beatriz who helped us with activities and reservations throughout the stay and Paulo who made my return to the hotel amusing each time.

Despite some minor shortcomings I would have given Corpo Santo the highest possible score as the team really went above and beyond. cons: Sadly my experience was completely tarnished during our visit to the hotel bar on the last night.
The waiter who took our order brought me the wrong beer which of course is absolutely not an issue in its own. Mistakes can happen we are all humans after all. What cannot happen and is completely unacceptable on the other hand is him starting an argument with me; blaming me for ordering the wrong item. For the sake and clarity of the review I won’t go into granularity. But even IF I was ambiguous with my order there is no need trying to educate your guest on the differences of beer especially a connoisseur who has tried thousands.
Long story short the waiter continued blaming and lecturing me on the differences of beers. Despite my attempts of stopping this argument - “Please just bring me the beer I wanted” - he continued his barrage. At this point I stood up and left the bar.

Needless to say my final review score reflects this incident. While it can be seen as a small fly in the ointment it has left a major aftertaste; sadly not of the beverage that I ordered in the first place."

In August 2022 I spent 7 nights at this beautiful hotel as a solo female traveler.  The hotel was centrally -located and I was able to walk to several main tourist sites.   The location was perfect!

The hotel goes above and beyond to spoil its guests.  The hotel offers complimentary snacks fresh fruit  ice cream and bottled water in the lobby 24/7.   Hot and cold midnight snacks are served nightly in the lobby. The hotel hosts daily complimentary wine and snacks in the lobby every evening at 6:00 p.m.  The hotel also offers free walking tours to guests and complimentary 20-minute massages in the spa.   Breakfast was included in my rate.  I enjoyed breakfast every morning at the on-site restaurant. The food was fresh and tasty.  The staff was over-the-top with excellent customer service.   I felt like royalty during breakfast with several servers tending to me making sure I had everything that I needed.   Immediately upon sitting guests are served a basket filled with baked goods a plate of sliced fresh fruit and a plate of meat and cheese.  Then you are offered a menu to order freshly prepared hot or cold breakfast.  I was never able to finish all of the food (despite having a large appetite).

The beds are extremely comfortable and the linen is very plush.   I was pleased to find a hair driver flat iron coffee maker kettle and a flat iron in my room. cons: On several occasions despite having a “Do not disturb” sign on my door I returned to my room to find that my room had been cleaned.  One morning a housekeeper entered my room unannounced as I was undressed.   Unfortunately the complimentary mini bar did not work and the drinks inside were room temperature.   I called the front desk a couple of times.  Eventually the refrigerator was replaced.  


Apart from a few minor issues my stay at the Corpo Santa Hotel Lisbon was fabulous.  I was sad to leave this hotel.   Diana Guitana Leticia Paul Magalhaes and Beatriz Silvestre were amazing as was most of the staff."

The employees always seemed relaxed and in a good mood even when there was a lot going on. I felt completely welcome. Everything was very clean and comfortable. I am a noise sensitive person and had moved from another hotel to the Art Legacy because of the noise. The room here was very quiet and the windows were well insulated I heard very very little of the traffic outside so I was able to sleep easily. I was happy that I moved here and finally had some peace and quiet. The breakfast was very rich and there were lots of healthy things. There was a buffet and you could order specialties à la carte it was very tasty. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who values ​​a good atmosphere and/or is noise sensitive. cons: The locking mechanism of the doors like most hotels is something that could be improved. The doors close loudly and you can hear it when neighbors leave their rooms. It was better here than in many other hotels but it can still be optimized. There were also sharp corners on the bed that I hit myself on a few times.

The staff was exceptional—friendly accommodating and always willing to help with recommendations or any requests. The room though decorated in bold red tones was still comfortable and stylish with all the amenities you could need. The location couldn’t be better—right in the heart of the city center within walking distance to many iconic landmarks and attractions. It’s a perfect base for exploring Lisbon. Overall a very enjoyable experience! cons: The room although stylish had a bold red color scheme that while unique made the lighting feel a bit dim. It would definitely benefit from brighter lighting to create a more inviting atmosphere.

The location is fantastic with plenty of easy access to a whole world of sights sounds and flavours. The staff are exceptional in every way that you can imagine. Breakfast is a must experience feast. Dinner at the restaurant felt like a fine dining experience. The rooms are so stylish and you will feel like are walking through a colourful dream. The head chef is supremely talented an absolute gentleman and chatted with us as if we were his old friends coming to visit him. Their entire team will make you feel like royalty. You will leave with a heavy heart because you couldn’t stay longer but will still manage a smile because you gifted yourself this experience. cons: There is nothing that I didn’t like about this gem.

Meals prepared in the restaurant (breakfast/dinner) were excellent prepared to your taste by the team both chefs/front of house...... The personalized walking tour provided by duty managers of the rich history of Lisbon and locations within 1km radius of hotel was outstanding as an introduction to the city and its rich history.
The attention of duty teams each day in lobby restaurant bar waiters & porters was superb and the unseen cleaning team in preparation of facilities ensured no details were left unchecked at any time. Many thanks to all and look forward to our return cons: A little more space in room may be appreciated but not a lot the duty teams can do about layout"

The dim lighting largely due to the room’s color scheme also made the space feel less inviting. While the hotel still offers great service and a fantastic location we found the room a bit lacking in comfort during this visit.

However the bathroom is pleasantly large with a shower.  A 4* yes but not a 5* hotel.

Good hotel location cons: Very small bedroom that is impossible to move around in comfortably

Unsafe bed with sharp corners that you constantly bang your feet against

Unsafe glass partition in the bathroom. Hit our head on it several times during dark hours.

Large but not equipped second room in which it is impossible to set up a workplace. Lots of space but everything is inconsiderate. It would be better to increase the size of the bedroom. 

Sometimes at breakfast there are no free tables and you have to wait for your turn. The staff can not cope with the flow of people and can forget about your order. 

Weak English language skills despite the fact that most of the guests speak English.

The baby crib was provided without a blanket and pillow citing internal regulations.

Dirty toilets on ground floor.

No one helps with luggage when you check out. Even the transfer driver was extremely surprised by this attitude."

Rooms nice but quite basic limited amenities. Definitely not what one would expect for this price point.

As part of the experience we received daily treats from a bottle of wine the first day to bottle of local cheery liquor or port with accompanying snacks which made the stay even more special for us. cons: The location in Chiado is very convenient to shops and restaurants and is very central. That said the downside is that the hotel is surrounded by local bars that are very popular with young adults so it's not unusual them to congregate and party outside in the streets which can make it quite noisy at 3 AM. That said the hotel does have thick windows and window treatments that did help to dampen the noise.

It was a beautiful shady spot with a nice breeze despite 95 degree temps. It had a snack shack that sold little plates of food and drinks and was open till 2am.

It is a beautifully renovated old Palacio.  The interior is exquisitely done without being over-the-top. Very tasteful and subtle. The food was also superb with an impressive wine collection and an equally impressive sommelier. cons: It was not the hotel’s fault but the month of a June is the Festival month in Portugal.  The green space across the road is one of the major venues for celebrations and late+night partying.  It was noisy until midnight.

I would have liked that when I arrived someone would explain to me why ""wine experience hotel"" and what kind of experience we could have. I left without knowing it.
And personally I did not liked the internal view of the bedroom I understand is the cheaper one but for me was a bit claustrophobic also if there was the view of a beautiful lobby. And in the end I would have loved it if there had been a spa with a sauna steamer and whirlpool for the hotel guests."

The room was on 2nd floor so the noise from the bars was loud. It was less with windows closed but then the room was stuffy.

Short downhill walk to train station for access to Sintra etc and Baixo / Chiada metro station <10mins walk too. Everything was crisp and clean and nicely finished rooms. Restaurant was very good and sommelier is passionate about local wines / ports and knows his stuff. Great cocktails and conversation in bar afterwards too cons: At time of our stay we understand the hotel has only been open approximately 1 month so still experiencing some expected teething problems - one of which was rain coming through the atrium roof - room would benefit from extra cupboard space if tea/coffee maker was relocated but these are minor niggles overall would highly recommend

Though building itself looks big its a relatively small. Staff is young and in our case very helpful approachable friendly and speaking fluently English. Location is great for a city hotel. Bairro Alto just a few steps away from elevador de gloria and a nearby parc with great views. Building itself is beautifully restored old former palace with a mixture of old/new decor. Do make an effort and climb up via old stairways. Booked comfort double with inner courtyard view. Room and bathroom were OK sized (room 409) exactly what i expected. As it is an inner courtyard it was despite quite loud ""surroundings"" completely silent (after midnight and until start of the breakfast). It also includes Caudalie toiletry. Service was top notch. Bonus was a daily small gift in the room (for example pasteis de nata chocolates...). Breakfast was good with quality stuff selection was a bit smaller than in other 5* hotels... though hot dishes were freshly prepared upon request (and quickly provided). cons: It has some quirks of a new hotel and things could be quickly resolved others probably not. In the bathroom unfortunately sink has a design flaw and water stays in even when emptied. Also there is a lack of storage space to put you toiletry bag around the sink. There are no paper napkins anywhere in the room (or bathroom). Regarding the room note that 409 has an interior patio view. Unfortunately lights are not dimmed during the night and patio remains relatively bright (though one can completely close the shutters to darken the room). As mentioned before breakfast was ok staff attentive. What i do not understand is the fact that you have to ask for water or juice and you cannot fill up your glass alone (waiter comes and fills your glass). It would be much easier if they just had water bottles for guests to pick up and that would also help during busy hours. For example during busy sunday breakfast staff seemed overwhelmed with requests orders and restocking self service."

The room was great spacious clean the beds are comfy the design is great.
The bathrooms are also huge clean and just perfect.
The smell everywhere is great the views from any corner of the hotel were just great.
The location is awesome very close to everything ask the staff for recommendations on food and bars they gave us very good options.
The breakfast was exceptional I believe that they bake everything in-house they just taste so fresh and good I already miss the breakfast.

I understand that this is a new hotel and they are trying their best every day we would walk into a clean room with a bottle of wine/champagne and some desserts (which I know might be just because they are new since I never experienced such) but this was a nice gesture from them.

I've stayed in over 80 hotels using booking none less than 4 stars and mostly 5 stars. This was by far the best one I've stayed at.

The friendliest people cleanest room most artistic place I will definitely return to it. cons: Nothing."

My room was just lovely. cons: When I arrived to check in (My flight 7 hours late) I was warmly greeted. Then the phone rang and the person proceeded to deal with them. I stood there and  listened to him explain that they should probably email the hotel directly. They were on one of the Booking sites and the site was missing information... 5 minutes have gone by now... He keeps advising they should email and that they would get a MUCH better rate booking directly with the hotel. I have to say aside for delayed flights one of my biggest pet peeves is employees servicing phone clients vs ones in person. It is so unprofessional.  Learn how to say HOLD PLEASE or don't take the call. I am sure you have VM. Also nice to know I got ripped off using a booking site...
Asked for some restaurant recommendations. He eluded the the Hotel Restaurant is very expensive.. (I then hear Anna Delvay saying ""you think I'm poooouuur"" in her classic voice...) I passed on his suggestions and went to the hotel restaurant. Lovely restaurant. I went to sit at the bar. Greeted by the bartender. Ordered some wine. Looking over the menu. Another guest comes in. He has been there a few days and they chat wine and he gets a glass.. then the Bartender offered to carry the gentleman's wine back to his room...off they go... I am sitting there... alone. SO HUNGRY. After 15 minutes I got up and found a server and asked if I can order. I ask for Foe Gras and the Garlic Shrimp. He says sure... 10 minutes later they both come out together..UGH. Still no bartender and my glass is empty. Another couple have walked in and sit down only to leave after 10 minutes of no one in the room. A good half hour late the bartender appears. Looking a bit disheveled. Hmmm ... He then does that thing where he rubs his face and nose with his hands... then proceed to touch glasses. I lose my appetite.
Foe Gras was good. Not enough bread as usual. The shrimp nothing special.
Hotel is lovely.  Staff need serious 5 star training."

There are several small cafes nearby. On Saturdays there's a street market just up the hill which was neat. And the view of the city from the adjacent plaza was majestic. cons: The hotel was not ready for prime time having just opened a few weeks earlier. The TV had no power cord and was covered in construction dust. The bathroom was clean but had an unpleasant wet smell. The light switches were poorly marked and designed. This room was on the backside right over a neighborhood bar which was very very noisy well into the night (though the hard shutters over the windows helped a little bit). There is no business center (more on that in a moment) and the ""Wine Experience"" off the lobby was not yet completed.

A good test of a high-end hotel is how well they can assist a guest with a problem. We needed to take COVID tests that required the use of a desktop or laptop with a camera. When asked if we could use a hotel computer we were told no -- none were available (there were two at the reception desk in front of us!). They suggested ""checking at the library"" (about 15min away) or trying one of the other hotels several blocks away. Since we don't speak Portuguese we asked if they might call one or two hotels to make the inquiry for us and they refused. Flabbergasted we struck out on our own and managed to find a hotel that helped us without hesitation -- Bairro Alto Hotel which is where we'll be staying next time we're in Lisbon."

The shower didn't function properly and the water spilled out of the shower unless the glass door was closed which I found claustrophobic and there wasn't a waist paper basket.

- good central location beautiful building cons: Stayed one short night after a night out in town as we live close to Lisbon. Unfortunately we could not enjoy our stay at all. For 350 euro/night what we got was a room with bad sound insulation on the second floor in the backside of the hotel where there is some Erasmus student party place with lots of people noise and loud music until like 5AM. The sound insulation is completely inadequate and it's pretty much as if the party is happening in your room. This is definitely not what you sign up for at this price point. Moreover the hotel was pretty empty and for sure the staff is aware of the weekend noise so it would only require minimal thoughtfulness not to put guests on lower floor rooms on that side if there is other options available. When I complained about the problem at check-out the staff didn't offer any gesture to make up for the bad experience other than 'I am sorry to hear you had a bad experience'.

In general I feel this hotel claims to be 5 star but isn't really one. It's a nice building and room although despite wanting to be boutique it misses soul and has a corporate/formula feel to it. Details that make the difference like not having tissues in the room the soap dispenser in the shower not working the room being a bit cold but the airco control unit not working use of cheap construction materials like laminate fake wooden floors instead of real ones and the noise problem above ... all take away from the 5 star feeling and made this a subpar experience."

Door opened into bathroom and made it very cramped. Breakfast was ok but not great. First day it was a buffet and after that they brought out everyone a fixed selection with a few added options. If I just wanted fruits or nuts for breakfast one dayfor example I would only get the standard allocated portion and nothing more.

The staff was so kind and welcoming. Bruno was really amazing many recommendations of where to go how to get there super helpful and kind. I felt like we were friends and got to know him while I was there for 4 nights.  I needed to get out of a terrible Airbnb situation and booked this hotel because I needed comfort and a place I could rest and still be in central Lisbon (I did not have a car) they were wonderful. The room was lovely peaceful and quiet. The breakfast buffet each morning was extremely nice and everything you could ever want. Impeccable service. Don’t miss the hotel restaurant for a first class dining experience. They have a great Chef waiters who know regional wines of Lisbon and Portugal. 5 stars. cons: This has nothing to do with the hotel or their staff but realize you are in the heart of Lisbon. The Chiado neighborhood is vibrant and lively and active until later in the night. You will hear noise and partiers from local bars all around the area. Music singing people out quite later especially the weekends. It didn’t bother me though at all. I bring earplugs and close the windows. I slept very well and kind of enjoyed the vibe there it’s a wonderful place easy access to lots of restaurants bars etc.

The room was nice despite glitches here and there. The staff was hospitable. The breakfast was very good in an impeccably prepared room. cons: A bedside lamp didn't work.

It felt like we were part of their family. The location is great for walking and has by far one of the best coffee shops right across the street. It is hilly but that is Lisbon so be prepared. cons: It is hard to find any faults as it was perfect for our stay in Lisbon.

The hotel is a new hotel  running for about a month or two so everything is new and beautiful! The location is the best! In the heart of everything but still in a nice and  quiet . Staff was very nice and welcoming. Cute breakfast not big but totally has everything you need. Everything is clean an new so that’s nice but they are still adjusting to the routine of being an hotel cons: Since the hotel is new you could feel  that some of the workers are not fully on top of everything.
The cleaning staff often forgot to do something in the room ( put more soap or put new towels) but one call to reception and they responded in a heart beat! 
The workers at breakfast did not always speak English and did not understand whether you wanted milk or caffè lattes .. but the is very minor things for a new hotel."

We picked this hotel because of its amazing location. The ambiance was a wonderful surprise very warm and welcoming and beautifully decorated by the Vista Alegre brand. Everything looks just beautiful and it has everything you really need for a Lisbon stay. The location is very central walking distance to almost every major sight and really close to the river. Very lively area but the hotel feels very quiet and safe. Our room was very large and comfortable and overlooking a nice public square. The staff is very friendly and always helpful. We truly enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend. cons: "

Breakfast was also good. cons: After first night reported air conditioning didn’t work and shower didn’t drain. They fixed the shower drain and said they replaced the ac Filter. Spent night 2 again with no ac. Morning of day 3 one of the front desk people said to be honest the ac was broken and could not be fixed until we checked out of the room. Said they would give us another room to which we had to pack up and move ourselves. When we went out that evening the hotel director was at the front desk and we asked if there was to be some concession for no ac for 2 nights and the inconvenience of having to move and if we hadn’t asked they would not have told us the truth or given us a different room. She was very unkind and rude and said you got a different room.  If she is the face for  the hotel I feel sorry for them. For a 5 star hotel it lacked customer service mainly because of her! Our next stop in Seville (another 5 star hotel) we got a welcome bottle of champagne with a note from the GM. Last night there another note from GM with a lovely Cheesecake thanking us for our stay. A real 5 star hotel! We are traveling 27 days between Portugal and Spain and by far the stay in Lisbon was the bottom of the barrel for 5 star hotels! Please get a different hotel director that knows  anything about customer service.

The staff in the restaurant at breakfast were brilliant and so were the cleaning staff. The shower was great and the water pressure was perfect. I also liked the decor in the hotel it had a luxurious feel to it. The housekeeping staff also ironed a dress for us really quickly and graciously which we really appreciated. The door staff/porters are very professional and polite. cons: The front of house lady barely welcomed us before demanding our passports - it felt like we were being inspected rather than welcomed to a hotel. There's no music or atmosphere in the lobby. We were also told our room wasn't ready even though we were 2 hours after check in. In the end the room was ready so this was an unnecessary confusion. For a 5 star hotel this was a disappointing first impression of the hotel that stuck with us - I've never had such a clumsy unwelcoming check in experience in a 5 star hotel. It's also EXTREMELY noisy and I had to buy earplugs to sleep due to the traffic/cobbled streets and nightlife being so close. You can hear the nearby nightclub music from the room. I also feel the breakfast options weren't great (unless you want multiple egg options). Compare this with a W Hotel or a Sheraton 5 star and you'll be amazed at how comprehensive the breakfasts are compared to the one on offer here.

- Pros: The room is very modern and dazzling spacious and offers a good view (depending on the specific room).
- Cons: The bathroom tub shower is quite high which poses a significant risk of slipping when getting out after a wet shower.

Breakfast:
- Pros: There is a huge spread available which would delight many meat lovers. The price is reasonable at 25 euros per person.
- Cons: There is no à la carte option and the healthy and vegetarian selections are very limited. Additionally the food lacks flavor and there are no spicy ketchup or even regular ketchup options.

Room Service:
- Pros: There is a good variety of options and delivery is timely.
- Cons: The same item can come with different assortments. For example I ordered mushroom egg whites twice: one day it arrived with a nice assortment of breads granola yogurt cappuccino etc. while on the second day it came with just toast coffee and some unappealing green yogurt with no nuts granola or fruit which was very disappointing.

Other:
I used the gym and jacuzzi both of which were fantastic. I also dined at the Allora restaurant where the food and service were top-notch. The front desk staff was extremely courteous and helpful; they even arranged a table fan for my wife.

Overall: This is a very modern high-end hotel with a multitude of facilities and a central location. However I would recommend avoiding their most basic room due to the tub shower. Additionally I suggest finding a different breakfast place. cons: Please see above"

We just opened the windows to air it out. Some hotel perfume would have been a nice touch to mask the smell.

The breakfast was v lovely and varied. The room was extremely comfortable and relaxing. Booked a joint massage session with my partner .. would highly recommend. Booked the 75 minute session and was so so relaxing and invigorating. Thank you for all the Spa staff for making this a v special treat for me and my partner. cons: The only slight thing to mention is that breakfast was not as relaxing as other 5 star Hotels. The table staff were wonderful but very busy. The staff replenishing the breakfast items seemed stressed and rushed. Realise that it's a 5 star hotel but maybe an option of self service coffee machine might help relieve some pressure and for me something that I would prefer.

2) Appreciated the young woman (with eye glasses) who was the concierge who gave good information or travel directions.
3) Appreciated the breakfast choices. A very good assortment for every food category from fresh fruit cooked-to-order eggs breakfast pastries etc. Nice breakfast staff too. 
4) Very pretty rooftop pool area.
5) There was a bottle of wine (which we didn’t drink) and 3 mini “welcome” pastries in the in-room table upon our arrival. (Not enough for 2 people to share equally but a nice thought).
5) Our son and his roommate got the last two spots for a massage at the spa and said that it was a wonderful experience. They also liked the steam room.
6) Allora restaurant on the ground floor was our first meal and last meal in Lisbon. They were able to safely accommodate my son’s nut allergies. Delicious Italian food in a lovely setting. cons: 1) Our son has severe (life and death level) peanut/treenut allergies. We were told at the first breakfast that almost everything either had nut ingredients or could not be trusted for cross-contamination. He went without breakfast for the first 4 mornings😠.  I had to find an Aldi market to buy him safe food and even that was hard to find.  The man at the front desk gave us awful directions to find one market (which we never did find) and despite me having arthritic feet we just kept walking until we found the Aldi on our own. 
2) My husband and I were not able to get massages (something we had looked forward to on this vacation) because we gave the last two available openings to our son and his friend/roommate. 
3) We did not care for the room light and window draperies being tied to the room key being put in the wall slot. Room light operation was difficult to understand.
4) All the breakfast restaurant food was good but the “juices” tasted like nothing but colored water- -very weak taste.
5) Although we were on the 8th floor the street traffic noise (perhaps motorcycles?) woke us up every single day. More should be done structurally for noise prevention."

The first stay began and ended by the most amazing service team. Beatrice and Carolina at the front desk were so kind and warm after an experience I had with canceled flights. I was completely frazzled...they just did everything to welcome me and make me feel at home. So much was the entire team .. especially room service  doorman/bellman just exquisitely wonderful....that when I checked out the first time...and was eventually heading to Albufiera in the Algarve ...I made my week long reservation for their Sister property called the Epic Sana Algarve. I will be forever grateful for both properties and all of the support staff and I will be a life long customer at this marvelous Hotel brand.

I have to say this is not the case here.. the staff on the rooftop bar were so friendly kind and hard working. The cleaning staff were also very bubbly and cheerful - which can be hard to maintain given the hard work turning over rooms at that scale. The rooms are immaculate spa area and gym really airy spacious and clean. The Pool is beautiful.. felt so relaxed. All in all I feel this hotel deserves its 5 stars. Exceeded my expectations on so many levels. Cant wait to return.. cons: One very minor thing is the toilet seats in common areas are black and peeling away in a lot of areas like the spa and pool toilets. But that’s clutching at straws.

Then she said that she was going to do me a favor and give us a room on the 7th floor instead of 5th.  I could have cared less which floor we were on.  What I cared about is that we were very tired from six hours of travel and we were forgotten about. We selected a higher level hotel because we wanted the service that should be there.

We met people at the buffet who weren't even staying at the hotel but went there for the food. it was SO GOOD. Definitely include breakfast in your booking! The staff is AMAZING - they were able to get us dinner reservations when the restaurant website wouldn't let us and they helped us figure out which beach to go to where we would have sun protection access to food and bathrooms. I also got a massage scub aromatherapy thing at the spa downstairs which was totally worth the money - afterwards they guide you to a little relaxation room with soft lighting and curtains and they provide you with healthy snacks (dried fruit and nuts) and herbal tea. I also used the gym it was a lot nicer than most hotel gyms and had towels water bottles (both room temp and refrigerated) cool washcloths in the fridge yoga mats kettle bells free weights and a punching bag in addition to the usual treadmills ellipticals rowing machine etc. Everything was in good condition. The Allora restaurant is on the ground floor we went for dinner - the food and service there was excellent. Definitely ask for the port! cons: some stuff that the hotel can't really control at this point: the lighting controls are weirdly complicated we kept accidentally turning the wrong lights on or off. The bathroom door is weirdly hard to close - it's a sliding door and easily bounces back open if you don't slowly deliberately close it. Cleaning - make sure your little door signs indicate you want the room cleaned - they do a good job with cleaning (even folded my clothes which i was not expecting) but i think one of the small signs says to skip it which i missed one or two days. Room service menu is a little limited imo but still good.

We had mentioned in our booking that it was our anniversary and the hotel surprised us by leaving a bottle of sparkling wine and a platter of chocolates macaroons and fruit in our room! cons: We paid for a city view and from the 10th floor had a view of the roof of a car park and apartment block across the road no big deal but would advise not paying extra for it.

Taxis and Ubers were always available. cons: I specifically requested a room with 2 twin beds even wrote the hotel ahead of time to further confirm the bed type. They wrote back and confirmed. But when I arrived they gave me a room with one bed. I was moved to another room but had to assist the staff to physically separate the one bed into 2 beds and re-arrange other furniture. One of the ""perks"" was welcome dessert and wine. Because I had to change rooms the dessert and wine did not follow. I called the front desk they sent a bottle of wine but no dessert."

Staff were super friendly the room cleaners were really polite and conscientious. Loved the 12 o'clock checkout it meant we could have a slow last morning which was really appreciated. The spa facilities were really nice the treatments were too expensive for us unfortunately. The sensory shower was my highlight. cons: The lifts - they were really slow possibly there aren't enough to service everyone at busy times like breakfast. We also got stuck in a lift one night which was quite scary. The rooms were quite soundproof apart from our last night as the people next door were really loud. The curtains didn't block out a lot of light some eye masks would have been appreciated. Rooftop pool was not heated so we didn't go in this was a shame as that was one of the biggest draws for booking this hotel further out of town than other options for our group.

The Tuk Tuk tour they suggested and arranged immediately was incredible.  The pool was great - shame the outdoor one wasn’t open but we had fun in the indoor one.  
Bar was lovely to sit at night having cocktails and listening to live music.
Walking distance to other restaurants and easy cabs to see the rest of Lisbon.
Hotel smells amazing has a real high end atmosphere. 
I loved the Italian restaurant they have too. cons: The iron ironing board and hairdryer could do with upgrades given the high end nature of everything else.  There also wasn’t much room to hang clothes if you’re there for a longer stay - although the hotel delivered us a few more hangers on request which was great. 
The shower is great and powerful although the bath is very high to climb in if you’re someone who struggles with that."

All the staff were really friendly helpful and spoke great English. The room was lovely and modern. We were given sweet treats and a bottle of wine in our room upon arrival which was a nice surprise. Overall it was good value for money. Both pools were not working when we arrived but the hotel paid for us to get a taxi to and from their sister hotel which was a few minutes away so we could use their pool. The pools in both hotels were lovely. cons: The outdoor pool was closed when we arrived because of the poor weather and construction works. I understand they can't help the weather but we would've liked to know beforehand if it was going to be closed because of construction anyway as we didn't get to use it at all and it was a big reason we chose the hotel. The Italian restaurant and lobby bar were both very nice but too expensive in my opinion.

The gym is great not huge but well equipped. 

The bar was great and likewise the performers. 

Excellent staff too. cons: The pools were closed for renovation which wasn’t said on site/booking.com or at check in. That was a major disappointment as it’s why I chose to go here. 

However the hotel did contact me once I brought my dissatisfaction to them and we came to a suitable resolution. 

Had they been open this would have been a 10/10"

The reception and concierge just made you feel at home Sandra and Ruben (I think)  are outstanding and Karim the duty manager is amazing… cons: The only wrinkle was the sauna was being worked on along with the rooftop pool….But we were told that we could go to their sister hotel and use their facilities and the hotel will pay for taxis….(So not all bad)"

Although the hotel arranged a taxi for us to go to a different spa it was not quite the same as it involved more planning. 

There was also an odd situation where a stranger found out our name/room number soon after we checked in and tried to come see us pretending to be our son. The hotel did inform us about the incident promptly and gave us a new room but it made for a stressful first day. 

Finally we had housekeeping (try to) enter our room once at 9.30pm and once while we were at dinner to bring items we didn't request like chocolate or weirdly on our final night slippers. While they probably meant well this left us feeling on edge a bit as it started feeling like we could be disturbed any time day and night."

We had hard time picking what to eat and the taste didn't match our expectations due to  as mention earlier vegan or gluten free food."

The main Italian themed restaurant is high quality and the chefs skills are on open display with an open kitchen. Try and book a seat on the counter to watch them  make your meal. Every single meal is prepared individually. A stand out dish was the octopus.

Aside that it is a great rooftop pool with comfortable sitting chairs and clean adequate towels . However There should be a shower provided near the pool area or even in the washroom for all who want to swim to wash down before entering the pool.

When we checked out there was an 80 euros charge. When we booked with Booking.com complimentary airport transfers were listed in the hotel description. This was extremely misleading and clearly not the case. We discussed this with concierge who informed that a number of other guests who had booked with Booking.com had also been led to believe the same and were equally disappointed. The hotel advised us to address this with Booking.com when we arrived home. I have written to customer service but have not yet had a response. We have noticed that the previously stated- “free airport transfers” has now been removed from the description on the Booking.com website for this hotel. We feel disappointed that our complaint has yet to be addressed and sincerely hope Booking.com will get in contact with us and other customers who may have been similarly misled.

Garden and pool are lovely. cons: A little away from the centre of things so I recommend taxis if you’re not fond of a lot of walking.

Very comfortable room with view of the Tagus and a modern and well equipped bathroom. Good dining options especially the bar where the staff could not be more helpful and where the menu is more varied and frankly much better than the more formal restaurant which we found very expensive for what was sadly an average meal. Buffet breakfast was superb. The hotel has an excellent range of facilities including a very relaxing garden and outdoor swimming pool. cons: Our only comment relates to the hotel’s position. It is not easy to access other than by taxi; it is a distance from the historic centre of Lisbon and is located underneath the flight path for Lisbon airport. As a consequence the outdoor breakfast area bar and garden can be quite noisy especially as jet aircraft tend to land every 5-10minutes!

Although we did not use the pool or spa facilities we visited these and thought they were great.  The pool and the gardens are beautiful....an oasis in the city of Lisbon.
The staff for the hotel were always attentive and welcoming. 
Overall we had a wonderful stay.  The only draw back is that the hotel is not close to the city center. cons: Distance to the city center is about 15 minutes away via taxi on a regular day....not walkable."

This is what I would describe as a classic ""old school"" hotel in the best sense of the word.

The breakfast is buffet style but in the grandest sense.  You get to choose from a wonderful selection of fresh breads pastries cheeses fruits cereals to hot breakfast foods such as scrambled/fried/boiled eggs bacon sausages mushrooms tomatoes.  Tea and coffee is served in silver pots.  There is smoked salmon and sparkling wine. The breakfast room is lovely and you can choose to eat inside the airy room or outside in the courtyard.

The heated outdoor pool and its surrounding garden are a beautiful oasis in a busy city that is pushed for space.  The adjoining bar serves great casual food.  We had the Salmon Poke bowl and it was delicious and very filling.

The main restaurant is serious silver service without being in the slightest bit stuffy or formal.  I would highly recommend the tasting menu.  You get to try the what I consider the highlights of what is on offer for a little more than 2 courses.  The chef is exceptional.  The room is beautiful and  in keeping with its traditional setting.  Lots of chandeliers swagged curtains flower arrangements.

The bar is just what you would expect from a hotel of this style.  Moody lighting with lots of red tones and dark wood.  Expert cocktails free bar snacks very friendly staff and a piano player to die for.

There is also a great indoor pool with a sauna and steam room.

Our room was spacious with a large marble bathroom and balcony. cons: This is not something that the hotel can change and it did not affect our stay but you should be aware that the pool is under the flight path of the airport.  So you will hear and see planes flying overhead during the day.  You will NOT hear them inside the hotel."

STUNNING grounds and the palace is so beautiful to walk thorough. The rooms are big and very comfortable.

The decor is from another time but it adds to the charm because you easily forget which year it is... cons: The spa facilities are beautiful there is a heated pool a steam room and massage cabins. We booked two body massages and we thought that the techniques could have been stronger. However when mentionned to the reception our two massages were immediately refunded and I'm sure our feedback was taken into account.

However there is a great rooftop deck above that has a great view as well and the staff gladly gave us drinks in nice plastic cups to take up there. All staff were extremely courteous and helpful.

The room was spacious elegantly furnished and impeccably clean. The attention to design and comfort was evident in every detail from the luxurious bedding to the stunning views of Lisbon's vibrant cityscape. I must also commend your team for their excellent concierge service. They provided invaluable recommendations for exploring Lisbon from must-see attractions to hidden gems off the beaten path. Their insights truly enhanced my visit and allowed me to discover the true essence of this beautiful city. I look forward to returning in the future and creating more cherished memories in your beautiful city. cons: The restaurant recommendation fell short of expectations. It resembled a tourist hub where one might dine only once. We were rather seeking suggestions for authentic cuisine and ambiance.

We had an unfortunate situation regarding our pre-booked transfer (outside of the hotel's control). The staff were very apologetic and succeeded in calming my wife down eventually! Special mention for the manager Isabela who was extremely polite and professional.

We stayed in a deluxe room which had a lovely balcony overlooking Rossio square. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was one of the best I have experienced in a hotel. The room was also very clean.

The breakfast was nice to have available and the coffee served was great appreciated this as I find it's often terrible in hotels. cons: The wifi was a little spotty occasionally but nothing major.

This year too after a whirlwind trip across Europe just to relax a bit before our flight back home we opted to stay at Altis Avenida again. We were checked in at the reception and were taken to our room and to our surprise when they opened the door it was the Presidential Suite. One of the best surprises.
Apart from this unexpected surprise (which anyhow bowled us over) the best part of our stay (both last time and this time) was the genuine warmth and the hospitality of everyone. Never once did I see anyone from the hotel staff not greeting us with a big smile and an eagerness to help. 
And we know that we will definitely comeback again. cons: Nothing as such."

When we requested ice staff were more than happy to accommodate but the only options were a bag or a bucket. We only needed enough ice for a couple of drinks so it seemed like overkill when we got a whole bucket. A small thing but we started getting ice in a glass from the bar instead."

The hotel is very well located near two metro stations and a train station right at the end of the Avenue da Liberdatea and minutes from Praca do Rossio perfect place to start exploring the city. 

The building itself and the rooms are very nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. 
It was also soundproofed from the street which is very important as cars drive by day and night. 
The wow of the building is the roof terrance where you can have breakfast or stay at the bar with incredible panorama views of the city. The bar is a night visit in the evenings!

But the star of this hotel are the staff. I can't remember the last place I felt so welcomed. Every interaction we had with them was exceptional. I am really sorry I did not catch all the names they are truly worth of praise but the few ones i remember - warm thanks to Ines from the reception desk Iasabel Julia and Frederico from the Consierge Telma and Patricio from the Restaurant and all the others - thank you! 

Just to give you an idea of the level of service... as a vegan as was a bit concerned I would not have much to choose from at breakfast. First morning when i go to breakfast i meet Frederico (who also happened to be vegan) and assures me that I am covered. If you have special needs they will check with the kitchen and try to make something happen. In a few minutes I had tofu an almond milk and a few vegan options for sandwiches. That was something. (But even without this I had plenty options at breakfast). Second morning I meet Telma at breakfast and i only say ""i'm vegan"" and she already knew what I had the other day and they brought it in. At the end of the week when Telma's shift had ended the person that came in Telma's place she also know what I have. Nice! cons: "

Staff bent over backward to be sure our room met our needs even offering a tour of the options so we could decide. The hotel is next to metro stop and train station as well as a lively square with many nice shops restaurants etc. Santa Justa elevator is a short walk. The breakfast room on the 7th floor has beautiful city views. We were on scooters and some areas such as the elevator were a bit tight but staff were right there to direct us to move furniture for us etc. Showing even more incentive they left the tables set up for us each day of our stay so we could enjoy breakfast easily. Everyone was pleasant helpful and efficient. The food was excellent with many hot and cold choices. I particularly enjoyed the pastels de nata and cappuccino. Each day offered a nice selection of fruit hot and cold meats cheese eggs yogurt etc. Another very nice touch by the hotel was a greeting gift of pasteis de nata and a bottle of port on our first day. Our room was a nice size and though on the street was very quiet. There are automated black out curtains in the room. Bottled water was gratis as was Nespresso. The bed and linens were very comfortable and we slept very well. A delicious piece of chocolate left with turn down service ensured we had sweet dreams. cons: No complaints. If we hit any obstacle being mobility challenged staff always jumped in to make it work for us. I particularly appreciated all the help in the gastropub for access to the patio as the high door jambs from the retractable doors created a challenge. The entire staff stopped everything to help get my scooter and I on and off the patio. Exceptional service...I really can't compliment them enough.
